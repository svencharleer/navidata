So we decided to test a digital prototype first.<br /> The backbone of the app is still missing. We use dummy data just to be able to get users comments soon.<br /> In the final version of the paper prototype. We had only very few, small issues so we decided to implement the solutions in the digital prototype immediately.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Goal:</span></p> <p>Once the digital prototype was finished, we tested it keeping 3 focus points in mind:</p> <ol> <li>Did the translation form paper to digital prototype succeed?</li> <li>What do users think about the (small) adjustments we made.</li> <li>Is it clear that you can give an overall good rating, but yet add a negative point to that same review.</li> </ol> <p>Here&#8217;s some extra explanation concerning those 3 focus points:</p> <ol> <li>We wanted to see weather the translation to a digital prototype brought any new issues. Even though the users were looking at almost exactly the same pages, there might be cases in which something is clear on paper, but isn&#8217;t in a digital environment.</li> <li>We made 3 adjustments: <ol> <li>We adapted the rating visualizer once again. The solution of centering the split point between green and red (see blog post 15 march) made perfect sense to us when we drew it on paper. Implementing this solution in a digital environment immediately made clear this was not the case. The central outlining point just wasn&#8217;t clear on screen. The bars seemed to appear random on the screen even though they were centred well. We decided not to test is with users because the three of us all felt the same about this solution: rubbish! Our new solution is to make two bars: one for the positive comments and one for the negative comments. <p><div id=""attachment_5202"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 294px""><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/chi-resultatenpagina.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image-5202"" alt=""De nieuwe lay-out van de resultatenpagina."" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/chi-resultatenpagina.png?w=450"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The bars for positive and negative ratings appear below each other.</p></div></li> <li>We also made a change to make the app more consistent. Since we focus on people in Leuven, we make our app in Dutch. In our paper prototype we printed the word &#8220;rate&#8221; on the button which has to be pushed to give an opinion on a frituur. But, obviously, this is an English word so we decided to print a Duch one: &#8220;Stem&#8221;.</li> <li>The last change is more of an omission: In our paper prototype we used tabs to make the difference between friends ratings and everyones ratings. We did not yet implement those tabs in the digital prototype so we just dropped this concept in this version of the test. Given the fact that there were no issues with those tabs in de paper prototype, we don&#8217;t expect users to have difficulties when we implement the tabs in the future.</li> </ol> </li> <li>In our first tests, we didn&#8217;t give the user freedom in rating a frituur. We were happy when he found the rating page and rated a frituur. But the users was not able to fill in comments (we already filled it in). In this iteration, we are letting the user decide for himself what rating he gives a frituur. We want to see weather it is clear that you can give an overall good rating, but yet add a negative point to that same review.</li> </ol> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Method</span>:<br /> To get user feedback we let them perform a specific task. We also used the think aloud technique. After the tasks are completed we ask the users about their experience, this could be seen as a questionaire.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Rationale:</span><br /> We wanted to measure the effectiveness of our app. By letting the users perform tasks we can see weather he can complete those tasks. The think aloud part permits us to see how users look at the application and thus see if he uses things the way they are intended to be used. The questionnaire permits us to ask the user more global questions afterwards.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Who what when?</span><br /> The tasks were performed by students computer science on an iPhone.</p> <p>the tasks consisted of:<br /> 1) Search a frituur within 2km from where you are right now.<br /> 2) Filter the frituren so you only keep the ones with &#8220;poor&#8221; in their name<br /> 3) undo this filter<br /> 4) Select the best frituur that meets your criterium (2km)<br /> 5) What is the address of the frituur?<br /> 6)What do other people think about the frituur?<br /> 7) When was the last time someone gave a negative rating to this frituur<br /> 8) You ate at this frituur and want to rate it you had: Many fries for a good price, lovely hamburgers but very distasteful mayonnaise. Give the frituur a rating.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Results:</span></p> <p>All users completed all tasks. That is a very good result we think! Most users liked the interface of our app. Which is always nice to hear. We will now go over all issues that surfaced, starting with the ones concerning the adaptations we made:</p> <ol> <li>Every users found the rating visualizer clear.</li> <li>There was one comment on the &#8220;Stem&#8221; button (during the questionnaire). For this user, &#8220;Stem&#8221; had an electoral connotation, so he assumed &#8216;stem&#8217; immediately meant he would give is &#8216;vote&#8217; to that frituur. We do not change this because the other users had no problems and also this user completed the rating task without problems. The user mentioned this issue during the questionnaire.</li> </ol> <p>Other issues:</p> <ol> <li>An issue that returns with most users is the sorting of frituren in the result list. We now sort the list by distance (nearest first). Every users seems to get that, but they&#8217;d also like to see a sorting which takes the ratings into account. So we decided to add an advanced filter which allows users to get a list with the best frituur on top. To do this, users will have to give a max. distance (this to avoid that you are in Leuven and get info on a very good frituur in Oostende).</li> <li>Al lot of users had problems with the map that shows the frituur location. When you try to scroll in the profile page and hold your finger on the map to do so, you only scroll the map in stead of the whole profile page. We will thus try to make the initial map an image, which can be clicked for further detail, if that is possible.</li> <li>Another problem is that some users didn&#8217;t find the map very useful. But the map didn&#8217;t show the data we wanted it to show (it does not work properly yet). It just showed an overview of Leuven. Which is not very handy indeed. We will thus not take this comment into account at this point, but return to it when it displays the data we want, and still get the comment that it is not handy.</li> </ol> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Conclusion:</span></p> <p>We think the translation worked pretty well. The fact that we had one important new issue shows that this digital prototype testing was not a bad idea. When testing the paper prototype, users didn&#8217;t care that much about the sorting of the list. We assume it just feels unnatural to think that you can sort a paper list. Hence, users didn&#8217;t complain about it back then. But in a digital environment, we immediately expect that a list is customisable/sortable.</p> "	2013/04/09 02:31:12 PM

Do they understand and find the functionalities?</p> <h4 style=""text-align:left;""><strong>Method</strong></h4> <p>We use the <a title=""Wizard of Oz Paper Prototyping"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment"" target=""_blank"">Wizard Paper Prototyping</a> method together with the <a title=""Think Aloud Protocol"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol"" target=""_blank"">Think Aloud</a> protocol.</p> <h4><strong>Rationale</strong></h4> <ul> <li>Wizard prototyping is highly applicable in our case because you can test en maybe adjust your prototype immediately. Different functionalities can easily be added or removed.</li> <li>Think Aloud allows us to look into the mind of the users and to collect their thoughts.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Who, What, Where, Time?</strong></h4> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;"">Who? 4 co-students, each belonging to a different group from the class User Interfaces.?</span></li> <li>What? In the first two tests, the users had to tell what they should do with the given prototype, without any information. What did they expect to happen when they executed their actions? The other two testpersons were asked to try some basic functionalities, namely give and like a tip.</li> <li>Where? The tests took place at the campus in the 200B building.</li> <li>Time? The duration of each test was 5 to 10 minutes.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Results</strong></h4> <p><span style=""line-height:13px;"">3 of the 4 people spontaneously told us that they liked the concept of the application! Yet there were some remarks:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;""><em>R1.1:?</em>The 4 testpersons all thought that the logo at the top of the site was a button. They also mentioned that it distracted them from the actual functionality.<br /> </span></li> <li><em>R1.2</em>: 2 users wondered if there was a friends-functionality en warned us for possible spam if the application was open to everybody.</li> <li><em>R1.3:?</em>One user asked if the possibility to send a tip to multiple persons exists.</li> <li><em>R1.4</em>: All testpersons clicked on the site-preview while this wasn&#8217;t a link to the tipped site and thus non-clickable.</li> <li><em>R1.5</em>: Two users didn&#8217;t exactly understand what the purpose of the notifications was.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4> <ul> <li>In general the users were very enthusiastic about the application.</li> <li>But a certain friends-functionality was clearly missed and will be included in the next iteration, just as the?possibility to send a tip to multiple persons (R1.2, R1.3).</li> <li>The previews will include a link to?the site they represent (R1.4).</li> <li>The logo will be smaller and moved to another location (R1.1).</li> <li>Notifications are not being handled in the next iteration, because this isn&#8217;t a basic functionality. Later on, we will elaborate this more (R1.5).</li> </ul> <h3 style=""text-align:center;""></h3> "	2013/04/13 07:06:50 PM

The professor showed some interesting YouTube videos. I recently searched around on YouTube myself to see if I could find some similar videos.</p> <p>One of the first videos I stumbled upon was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0"">Productivity Future Vision (2011)</a>. It starts off with a pair of glasses that instantly translates what is being announced. Perfect speech recognition and translation are two amazing feats already but what intrigued me most about this video were the holographic augmentations. I couldn&#8217;t really imagine how this could physically be possible unless if it&#8217;s similar to those 3D TVs without glasses.</p> <p>Searching around some more for holographic augmentations I found the video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89KxxpmMhi4"">The Holographic Home</a> that still showed some projection lines. This one actually looked as if it&#8217;s already possible today.</p> <p>A final interesting video is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_cdkpazjI"">A Futuristic Short Film HD: by Sight Systems.</a> It&#8217;s about a very invasive procedure that makes all physical interfaces obsolete. Let&#8217;s just say you can control everything with your eyes. The phrase &#8220;my sight crashed&#8221; and the creepy ending did make sure that I wouldn&#8217;t want to undergo this procedure myself tho&#8230;</p> "	2013/04/15 12:41:03 AM

This would&#8217;ve been redundant because the second task already included this.</p> <h4>Who, what, where</h4> <p>We tested with four test users during the studio session. The test took on average three and a half minutes.</p> <h4>Results</h4> <p><strong>P1.1:?</strong>Three users weren&#8217;t able to point out the incoming and outgoing interactions.<br /> <strong>P1.2:</strong> When asked about the general impression, two of the four test persons told us that they didn&#8217;t really understand how the filter button worked.<br /> <strong>P1.3:?</strong>The registration procedure wasn&#8217;t clear for two of the four test persons.<br /> <strong>P1.4:?</strong>It wasn&#8217;t possible to change the picture of the location after it was taken.<br /> <strong>P1.5:?</strong>The &#8216;sent&#8217; and &#8216;received&#8217; keywords weren&#8217;t consistent according to the test users.<br /> <strong>P1.6:?</strong>When executing task two the user notified us that he expected the new interaction to appear at the top of the list.<br /> <strong>P1.7:</strong>?Two test users weren&#8217;t able to send a reply on an interaction because they didn&#8217;t find the send button.<br /> <strong>P1.8:?</strong>There was a problem with he contact input field for two test persons.

However this post will not be about an interface iteration, but about the backend of our project.</p> <p>Our first idea was to work with Twitter. This has several major advantages:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:14px;"">Twitter has a large user base</span></li> <li>Twitter has valuable information about a user which we can use</li> <li>We can expect specific knowlegde and behavior from users: use hasthags, follow people, retweet, use short messages, &#8230;</li> <li>Twitter has a storage engine which we can use to present the data that has been generated by our application</li> <li>Twitter has a secure way of maintaining user information like names and passwords and you can connect to it with <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter"" target=""_blank"">OAuth</a></li> </ul> <p>Although all of these advantages should be true, we did experience two difficulties. First of all, the login with Tiggzi did not work. We did not succeed in getting the necessary tokens and keys to allow control of Twitter in our application (send tweets, follow people, &#8230; ).<br /> Another very important disadvantage was that the <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search"" target=""_blank"">search api</a> of Twitter only returns tweets of the last 6 to 9 days. We could accept this if we focus more on events instead of recommendations in general. But the search api also mentioned that it did not give all of the tweets that match your criteria and were posted in the last days. It will only give top tweets and you have no control about this.</p> <p>For us, those two advantages were too much. Because Tiggzi also provides a back end database as service and because we have enough knowlegde of databases we decided to maintain our own database.</p> <p>We kept it very simple with only 2 entities: a user and a message; and 3 relations: follows, recommends and likes. You can see the picture of the database model here:</p> <p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/knipsel1.png""><img class=""alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-426"" alt=""ERE Diagram"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/knipsel1.png?w=87&#038;h=150"" width=""87"" height=""150"" /></a></p> <p>Once our database is up and running and the connection to the user interface is fixed we will continue with a next iteration.</p> <p>During class, we also made a prezi about one of our previous iterations. If you want to check it out, you can click <a title=""Prezi"" href=""http://prezi.com/in1tvr9tbjqe/untitled-prezi/?auth_key=975a5e66d2c0451a1c70165e8c1a7f3c303b1af7&amp;kw=view-in1tvr9tbjqe&amp;rc=ref-3874860"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Be aware that it is in Dutch.</p> <p>What do you guys think about our decision? Do you perhaps have a better experience with the Twitter API and/or the Oauth protocol?</p> "	2013/04/16 09:44:01 PM

101929	jyyrcddc	posted	2013-04-20T15:56:47Z	(null) 	http://jetschi.wordpress.com/2013/04/20/manual-oauth-with-twitter/	(null)	(null)	chikul13	"<p>For our project, we intent to have users sign in with a 3rd party service. For now we have planned to implement Twitter, Google Accounts and Facebook login. It is very unlikely for a potential user not to have at least an account on <i>one</i> of these services. In this post I&#8217;ll talk about the difficulties we encountered when implementing &#8216;Sign in with Twitter&#8217;. We don&#8217;t have Google Accounts or Facebook login implemented yet, but looking at the API references for the three services it seems Twitter is the most complicated. This is probably because (unlike the other two) they use OAuth 1.0a, rather than OAuth 2.0. Before we get started, I&#8217;d like to point out that doing a manual implementation can be a time-consuming and slightly masochistic thing, so only do it if you like this kind of thing. Especially since there are <a title=""Twitter Libraries"" href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries"">plenty of people who have done it for you</a>.</p> <p>I won&#8217;t explain how to implement &#8216;Sign in with Twitter&#8217;, because Twitter already has <a title=""Implementing Sign in with Twitter"" href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter"">a very good guide</a> up for this. Instead I&#8217;ll be going over some small but hard to debug problems that may drive you crazy and possibly even make you give up if you can&#8217;t find them. In retrospect, the whole thing wasn&#8217;t actually all that complicated, it&#8217;s just somewhat hard to pin down the exact problem if it&#8217;s not working.</p> <h4>HTTP headers</h4> <p>When you&#8217;re debugging, make sure you can see all the headers of the HTTP requests you make and the replies you receive from Twitter&#8217;s servers. More information is always better, and headers that you may not have directly set can still cause problems.</p> <p>In our case, <a title=""PHP Client URL"" href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php"">cURL</a> was setting the <i>Content-length</i> header to a default value of -1 (it should have been 0 for a request without POST parameters), causing us to get a HTTP 400 Bad Request. Because I wasn&#8217;t watching my headers I thought our OAuth implementation made an error somewhere and spent a lot of time looking for an error that wasn&#8217;t there.</p> <h4>Percent-encoding</h4> <p>Sending authorized requests to the Twitter API requires you to regularly <a title=""Percent encoding on Wikipedia"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding"">percent-encode</a> some values. Doing it one time too many or too few causes your request signature to be wrong and then your request won&#8217;t go through.</p> <h4>Signature parameters</h4> <p>API requests using OAuth need to have a correct signature based on what you put in your request. Double-check whether you have put <b>all</b> parameters in your signature: GET, POST and OAuth parameters should all be in there, and need to be sorted lexicographically (as the Twitter Dev pages note: this is usually the default alphabetical sorting for most libraries).</p> <h3>Example request</h3> <p>There are of course a whole lot of bugs that can pop up, and the best way to find them is to have a reference value. The <a title=""Implementing Sign in with Twitter"" href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/implementing-sign-twitter"">&#8216;Sign in with Twitter&#8217;-guide</a> is one example (the consumer secret they used to sign the request is at the top of the page), and here we give you another one:</p> <h4>Input values:</h4> <ul> <li>url = h<span>t</span>tps://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token</li> <li>oauth_consumer_key = fakeconsumerkey</li> <li>oauth_timestamp = 123456789</li> <li>oauth_version = 1.0</li> <li>oauth_signature_method = HMAC-SHA1</li> <li>oauth_nonce = randomalphanumericstring</li> <li>oauth_callback = h<span>t</span>tp://anyurl.goes/even/localhost</li> </ul> <h4>Input to signing algorithm</h4> <pre>POST&amp;https%3A%2F%2Fapi.twitter.com%2Foauth%2Frequest_token&amp;oauth_callback%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fanyurl.goes%252Feven%252Flocalhost%26oauth_consumer_key%3Dfakeconsumerkey%26oauth_nonce%3Drandomalphanumericstring%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D123456789%26oauth_version%3D1.0</pre> <h4>Resulting request</h4> <pre>POST /oauth/request_token HTTP/1.1 Host: api.twitter.com Accept: */* Authorization: OAuth oauth_callback=""http%3A%2F%2Fanyurl.goes%2Feven%2Flocalhost"", oauth_consumer_key=""fakeconsumerkey"", oauth_nonce=""randomalphanumericstring"", oauth_signature_method=""HMAC-SHA1"", oauth_timestamp=""123456789"", oauth_version=""1.0"", oauth_signature=""4C5rk3aVpSsytkYbfDz2DZfcbZA%3D"" Content-length: 0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Expect: 100-continue</pre> <p>I hope this post can be of help to anyone wishing to implement the sign in procedure manually.

As a short blog, we will show you an overview of how our application currently looks and works. As we have explained before, we had a problem of scope creep. We tried to solve this, and as a result we now only have 5 major screens, plus 2 for Login and Sign Up. The 7 different screens are shown in the figure below. Placing the screens next to one another shows the simplicity and the recurring housestyle.</p> <div id=""attachment_446"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/allscreens1.png""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-446"" alt=""All Current Screens"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/allscreens1.png?w=300&#038;h=70"" width=""300"" height=""70"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">All Current Screens</p></div> <p>An overview of how the app works is given in a transaction diagram (See below).

From there you can login to our app or go to the sign up screen. The sign out button is only present in the home screen, as we figured not a lot of people need to sign out from an app on their own phone.<br /> From the homescreen you can navigate to EXPLORE, INBOX and OUTBOX. The RECOMMENDATION-button (+) is visible in all screens once logged in, including the homescreen.</p> <p>We experienced that creating an overview of the different screens and a transaction diagram is very usefull to check the <em>correctness</em> and unity of our app. What do you readers think? Can you find some strange decisions in our <a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/allscreens1.png"" target=""_blank"">screen overview</a> or <a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/transactiediagram.png"" target=""_blank"">transaction diagram</a>?</p> "	2013/04/23 06:01:34 PM

We divide all problems into two categories:</p> <ul> <li>changed,</li> <li>unchanged.</li> </ul> <p>Changing?an aspect of the app due to a problem depends on:</p> <ul> <li>urgency, i.e. how many test users?found the problem;</li> <li>ease of change, i.e. how easy it is?to solve the problem;</li> <li>overall effect, i.e. if?solving?the problem?makes the app more consistent, easier to use, more efficient,&#8230;</li> </ul> <p>Also note that the app got a (minor) style change. Instead of <em>standard blue-with-gray</em> we used red and different shades of gray to give our app a less bland look and make it stand our a bit more. We also use Facebook profile pictures to:</p> <ul> <li>allow users to?spot a specific Facebook friend more quickly;</li> <li>make requesting and suggesting to someone more personal and compelling.</li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Changed</strong></em></p> <p><strong>P2.1 The look of th</strong><strong>e reply screen and the position of its?various elements is confusing. (n=6/6)</strong></p> <p>As this was a problem indicated by all of?our test users, solving this problem got top priority. The?previous version of this screen (image 1, left) feels very inconsistent compared to other screens of the app as:</p> <ul> <li>this is the only place where a crucial button (Reply) is placed in the navigation bar;</li> <li>the contrast between the information displayed and the button with a reply makes the user want to click the given answer rather than the reply button.</li> </ul> <p>By making this screen more consistent with other parts of the app, the user feels more accustomed to the lay-out and button placement.?Similar to?the <em>send</em> and <em>request</em> buttons on other screens, the <em>reply</em> button is now found at the bottom of the screen (image 1, right). By displaying the answers in the same way we show posts in the activity stream of the main screen (image 2), we try to achieve a sense of familiarity, making it more &#8216;comfortable&#8217; to use. While the new version of this screen uses more words, it feels they are placed in a more structured way?and less random than its?previous counterpart.</p> <div id=""attachment_311"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 431px""><a href=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/requesti2i3.png""><img class="" wp-image-311 "" alt=""Image 1: Request screen (left: before, right: after)"" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/requesti2i3.png?w=421&#038;h=401"" width=""421"" height=""401"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Image 1: Request screen (left: before, right: after)</p></div> <div id=""attachment_324"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 253px""><a href=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/main-screen.png""><img class="" wp-image-324 "" alt=""Image 2: Main screen"" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/main-screen.png?w=243&#038;h=468"" width=""243"" height=""468"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Image 2: Main screen</p></div> <p><strong>P2.4 Unclear what can be searched for at the search screen.

The reason for change is that less search results will be displayed, allowing the person replying to find what they&#8217;re looking for faster. Although, it&#8217;s still possible to recommend a thriller to someone requesting a romance book, but it&#8217;s up to the person replying to recommend something that&#8217;s asked for.</p> <p><strong>P2.12 There is no button to exit the application or to log out.

(n=3/6)</strong></p> <p>We opted not to change the &#8216;request suggestion&#8217; screen. Not all combinations of type and genre exist, but this way, the user requesting something gets more responsibility. For instance, it&#8217;s possible to request a musical book, but if doing so,?users shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that they didn&#8217;t get a reply from others.</p> <p>However, we are aware that our list doesn&#8217;t contain all existing genres.

(n=3/6)</strong></p> <p>We&#8217;re fully aware that typing a full message is rather cumbersome to do on a smartphone. That&#8217;s why we opted to let users type as little as possible. However, we want to give them the freedom to?write an optional message along with their recommendation. In <em>positive remark 7</em> of our <a title=""Iteration 2"" href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/iteration2/"" target=""_blank"">iteration report</a>, a test user specifically said he liked the option to enter a message along with the recommendation.</p> <p>We make use of the iPhone&#8217;s?standard on-screen keyboard (image 3), but some users find the buttons a bit too small. We won&#8217;t change the way of typing a message because:</p> <ul> <li>this is a remark we got mostly from test users with little to no smartphone experience;</li> <li>a solution would be?to tilt the iPhone 90 degrees to?make use of a?on-screen keyboard with wider buttons, but?we&#8217;d have to implement an adapted?interface to go along with the changed dimensions of the screen.</li> </ul> <p><strong>P2.5 Requests arenu2019t specific enough. (n=2/6)</strong></p> <p>By not making requests too specific, the users get more freedom to reply with something they like. For instance, if a user would ask for a comedy movie, there are still many types of movies that can be recommended, as there are movies with for instance?absurd humour, British humour or those that are a bit more serious with just the occasional laugh now and then. By making the requests more specific (like a thriller book from a certain author), chances are that all other users will recommend the same title.</p> <p>However, it&#8217;s?not impossible that in future updates of our app, users could?specify their request with?<em>either</em> a genre <em>or</em>?an actor/author, but not both at the same time. Our app is not ment to be used as an advanced human search engine, as there are more efficient tools for those purposes.</p> <p><strong>P2.6 The word u2018requestu2019 isnu2019t clear. (n=1/6)</strong></p> <p>This problem was stated by a test user?before?tapping the request button (image 2) (problem stated in <em>negative remark 1</em> of <a title=""Iteration 2"" href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/iteration2/"" target=""_blank"">iteration 2</a>). Like every other app, there is a learning curve involved, requiring some effort to discover how an app works and to gain a little experience with it. We try to design our app in such a way that it feels <em>natural</em> to tap certain buttons by making buttons stand our and using verbs to express that they have a certain function.</p> <p>As only one test person?encountered this problem and the function of the button was clear after tapping it,?we?don&#8217;t consider changing?the name of the button.</p> <p><strong>P2.8 Button to start the search after typing something hard to find. (n=1/6)</strong></p> <p>The button is part of the standard keyboard (image 3). The?test user?who indicated this problem had no previous iPhone experience.

If I recall well it was mainly to focus on different courses, or do another course instead. Wouter and I decided to continue within this group. We created a paper prototype, and evaluated through user tests with the think aloud protocol. Next, we have been working on the digital prototype during the Easter holidays. However, due to some personal matters, Wouter has been unable to continue with the course. As the last remaining group member, it was a bit of a dilemma whether or not to finish the course.</p> <p>In the end I decided not to work further on the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Android</a> application we have been developing. As the project we had in mind was not that small, and my experience with Android is still rather limited. Instead I have been designing a new application. The application will allow <a href=""http://www.last.fm/"" target=""_blank"">Last.fm</a> users to recommend music to their friends on Last.fm. </p> <p>This time I will use mainly technologies such as <a href=""http://jquerymobile.com/"" target=""_blank"">jQuery</a> and <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/"" target=""_blank"">PHP</a>. Personally I find that scripting languages allow for more rapid development than the rather complex architecture of the object-oriented Android application. Another advantage is that I wouldn&#8217;t have to use the lovely Android simulator anymore. I&#8217;m sure there are alternatives, but that thing is slow as *<em>insert something really slow</em>*.</p> <h2>Planning</h2> <p>The planning as yet for the remainder of the semester is as follows: I will finish the evaluation of the paper prototype. Next I will try to work on the digital prototype until the end of the week. Hopefully I can complete enough of it to do some meaningful tests. Hopefully I can start adding some implementation by Tuesday, the next lecture for this course.</p> <p>It would be nice if those who have a Last.fm account, would let me know. The application for my thesis is also based on Last.fm data, so for those interested, they could also help me with the evaluation of that application.</p> "	2013/05/01 02:58:32 PM

After using the app at least one time, the hesitation should be gone. Overall the tests went well, so we can conclude that the current interface is easy to understand, and simple in use.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">2. Additional questions</span>: (questions, see above)</p> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">a. Most testusers hesitated a bit first, but then chose correctly. 1 user indicated that &#8216;inbox&#8217; and &#8216;outbox&#8217; are terms associated with e-mail, and thought it was less appropriate for recommendations.</p> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">b. Most testusers (n<sub>1-5</sub>)?found the &#8216;new recommendation&#8217;-button right away, testusers n<sub>6</sub>?and n<sub>7 ?</sub>had some trouble finding the plus-sign the first time.</p> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">c. all testusers would like to favoritise recommendations and most (5 out of 7) would also want to follow people. There was little interest (1 out of 7) for rating recommendations.</p> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">d. all testusers would like to resend recommendations. <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">4</span> testusers would <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">definitely</span> want to resend, <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">3</span> testusers would <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">maybe</span> want to resend recommendations. This should take at most 2 or 3 clicks.</p> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">e. 2 testusers definitely wanted to follow other people; 3 testusers wanted to be able to follow a category, for example based on the #tags. An about section of the app would be useful, said 1 testperson. The last testuser suggested to have a preview picture of each recommendation.</p> <p>Conclusion: The current interface is being well received by the testusers. But the questions clearly show there is a need for more functionality. For the moment we have a stripped-down application with only the bear minimum functionality. The answers to the questions indicate which new features are needed: the possibility to follow people and/or categories; the posibility to favoritise recommendations (and maybe view favo&#8217;s in a separate list?); an about section, and preview pictures for the recommendation (facebook-style?).</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">3. SUS Questionnaire</span></p> <p>The average quantified result of the SUS questionnaire (filled in by 5 testusers (n<sub>1-5</sub>)) is <strong>80</strong>. The site?<a title=""Measuring Usability"" href=""http://www.measuringusability.com/sus.php"">Measering Usability</a>?states that an outcome of 68 is average, so everything above 68 could be considered good. The site also states that a result of 80,3 could be seen as an A result (in the scale from A (=excellent) to F (=failed)).</p> <p>Moreover, this result can be used to compare this version of the app to next iterations.</p> <p>Due to a problem of the questionnaire site, individual SUS scores could not be calculated.

For example:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"">When people log in, you can nowhere see which user is logged in, this might be confusing.</span></li> <li>When first using the app it&#8217;s not clear what it is meant to do, therefore an &#8216;about&#8217; section could be useful.</li> <li>Some preview picture of the recommendation would be nice.</li> </ul> <p>All these issues will bring us to another iteration.</p> "	2013/05/02 08:53:21 PM

It can be considered an extension on the Last.fm social interactions through certain tags in the users&#8217; communication. If possible, data storage is kept at a minimum. Instead, some minor data mining is applied on user&#8217;s friend profiles to generate context for the recommendations that are interchanged between the users.</p> <p>The goal is the build a mobile App that forms the interface for this enhancement of Last.fm&#8217;s social interactions. An additional chrome extension can be developed as well to allow Last.fm users to send shouts from their browser that can be interpreted by the app.</p> <p>The first version of the app aims to support the following functionality:</p> <ul> <li>Create a status to ask for recommendations related to a certain artist;</li> <li>Reply on the status updates of friend&#8217;s to suggest a certain artist;</li> <li>Browse the friends list;</li> <li>Browse previously published statuses;</li> </ul> 	2013/05/04 12:30:01 AM

After some discussing about functionality we decided to go for the &#8216;follow&#8217; functionality. We implemented this in a way that you can follow people and then filter on it in explore. So you can decide in explore whether you want to see all recommendations or just the ones of people you follow.</p> <p>Unfortunately we had some trouble with the implementation. We could not do it completely in the Appery (Tiggzi) GUI and we all are quite the javascript noobies.. Result is that you can follow and unfollow people but if you use the filter, you only see recommendations of one person that you follow. We were also not able to switch between a follow and unfollow icon.. We realize that this probably isn&#8217;t so hard at all but it was taking too much time. Again this is a disadvantage of using a system, some tricks you have to do with hacks and this is harder then coding from scratch. Therefore we decided to let it be as it is and start a new iteration.

That makes it difficult to make a well thought-out decision on which frituur to visit.</p> <p>So for the further testing of the app, we decided to start with the second part of the application, rating a frituur. This we we could test the app and collect votes for the frituren at the same time.</p> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Goal:</span></strong></em><br /> Do the users manage to vote on a frituur they think of in advance. As a side goal, we wanted to test the use of the word &#8216;stem&#8217; on the button that leads to the rating page.</p> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Method:</span></strong></em></p> <ul> <li>Effectiveness: We stand next to the people executing the test. We keep track of their behaviour and see how they (not) reach the voting page.</li> <li>informal questionaire: After the test, we asked users to give comments on their experience with the app.</li> </ul> <p>After having tested 17 people, we added 2 small questions:</p> <ul> <ul> <li>We made a paper with 3&#215;2 keyword. For each keyword, they had to choose which of the two they felt fits the app best.</li> </ul> </ul> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/keywords-kiezen.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-5237"" alt=""keywords kiezen"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/keywords-kiezen.jpg?w=490&#038;h=367"" width=""490"" height=""367"" /></a></p> <ul> <li>During the informal questionaire, we explicitly asked users what they think about the use of the word &#8216;stem&#8217;</li> </ul> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Rationale:</span></strong></em></p> <p>When we let users rate a frituur using the app, many people told us things like: &#8220;This app looks great!&#8221;,? &#8220;I find it clear and easy to use.&#8221; Those comments were all nice to hear, but they are hard to use as objective measure. That&#8217;s why we let the second part of users decide between two keywords. This way we could attempt to get objective results.</p> <p>Only few people seem to? have problems with the use of the word &#8216;stem&#8217; when we do not explicitly ask them their opinion. So we extended the informal questionnaire with this explicit question.</p> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Who, What, When?:</span></strong></em></p> <p>27 people that were present in the computer science building on the campus. So they were mostly students compter science. <br />The first part of the test (without the keywords +? stem questions) was done by 17 users, the second part by 10. </p> <p>We asked the test persons to rate the frituur they last visited in Leuven. If possible, they made use of their own mobile device.</p> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Results:</span></strong></em></p> <p>Mainly, Users follow one of these flows to get to the profile page of a frituur:</p> <ol> <li>Search frituren in the neighbourhood &gt; Scroll through the (extensive) list to find the desired frituur.</li> <li>Search frituur by name or street &gt; select the desired frituur form the 1-3 leftovers.</li> </ol> <p>For this test, most users used the second flow (16 agiants 11) but both ways are used frequently.</p> <p>Every users managed to rate the frituur that he intended to rate at the start of the test. So that&#8217;s a great success!</p> <p>Out of the first 17 users, only 2 users mentioned that &#8216;stem&#8217; had electoral connotation for them. But when asked explicitly, 6/10 users said this to be the case. We assume users don&#8217;t think about what to expect from this button, and when the button takes them to a rating page, they immediately adapt to the situation. Although afterwards when they think about it, it sounds more logical to them there is no rating page.</p> <p>We will change the text on the button form &#8216;stem&#8217; to &#8216;geef je mening&#8217; to get rid of this ever returning small issue.</p> <p>Most of the first 17 users mentioned that they found the app easy to use, good looking and straightforward. The last 10 users had to choose keywords. None of them choose a word on the right side of the paper. All users chose the keyword on the left. One users had no opinion for the second pair of keywords. Another user left the choice between &#8216;eenvoudig&#8217; and &#8216;complex&#8217; undecided.</p> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Other issues:</span></strong></em></p> <p>We only take into account issues that returned more than once here. We will not change the app to support? solutions. This because we do not have much time left for this course and they are not issues that concern a lot of users. Moreover, most of the issues talk about extending the functionality, rathter than lacks in the current functions. </p> <ul> <li>We noticed the search function is very strict. It has no flexibility. St. Jacobsplein for example is not the same as Sint Jacobsplein. This caused users to not find their frituur from the first time.</li> <li>It would be nice to have a picture or logo of the frituur on the profile page, in order to a point of reference, according to 2 people.</li> <li>2 people clicked on the arrows that indicate the sore on a profile page, to give a frituur an immediate positive rating.</li> <li>3 people found the concept of the app too little.</li> <li>The app is less easy to use on slower smart phones, the loading of pages takes a while on devices that are less performant. This causes user to make clicks they did not intent.</li> </ul> <p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Conclusion:</span></strong></em></p> <p>We were really flatterd by comments that we got. People were enthusiast about our app. Of course we cannot know whether that is genuine enthusiasm. We were also glad that users managed to rate the frituren in no time.</p> "	2013/05/08 02:05:24 PM

119687	Sander Voeten	posted	2013-05-08T20:28:21Z	(null) 	http://chimovez.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/applicationbackend/	(null)	(null)	chikul13	"<p><strong>Facebook API</strong></p> <p>We started with the idea to persist our recommendations on Facebook. We chose for Facebook because we already used the Facebook API to handle our login and provide us with the contacts of the user.?Our application works as a one-on-one recommendation of a location that is assisted by a picture. Afterwards there can be a conversation between both users about the recommendation. In the beginning we thought that Facebook would allow us to persist and provide us all those features, but when we started the implementation, we soon encountered soms problems. All those issues were related to one subject and that is privacy. The Facebook API is able to create albums, upload images to those albums, read and write comments, but Facebook is not able to support the situation were you want to keep an album private but only accessible by one other person. After searching for a solution, we found out that in the previous versions of the (Facebook) Graph API the privacy parameter could be set to allow &#8220;Some friends&#8221;.</p> <pre>privacy={'value': 'CUSTOM', 'allow': 'SOME_FRIENDS', 'friends': '{friend-id-1},{friend-id-2}'}</pre> <p>In the latest version that feature is deprecated and it&#8217;s only possible to set the parameter to allow a certain friend list to get access to an image or album.</p> <pre>privacy={'value': 'CUSTOM', 'allow': '{friend-list-id}'}</pre> <p>These limitations of the API match by the way the absence of this feature on the website were it&#8217;s also not possible to make a picture only accessible to yourself and one friend without creating a friend list that only contains that friend. The &#8220;possible solution&#8221; would be to create a friend list for each friend with whom your share a recommendation. And when it would be possible to create invisible friend lists, we maybe would considered this option. But every friend list is visible on the Facebook website and we don&#8217;t want to pollute our users&#8217; FB accounts, so we had to work out another option.</p> <p><strong>Backend in CodeIgniter and imgur.com</strong></p> <p>Nik came up with the idea to use the PHP framework <a href=""http://ellislab.com/codeigniter"">CodeIgniter</a> for developing our own backend. So we build some tables for the recommendations and comments and put them in a MySQL database. With the PHP framework we created some Rest (API) Controllers to handle POST- and GET-requests for sending and receiving data from the database. This worked quite well and we first wanted to implement the image upload also with the framework. But why would we reinvent the wheel, when websites like <a href=""http://imgur.com"">imgur.com</a> already provide a decent image upload API?</p> <p><strong>Facebook message</strong><br /> To increase the reachability and to arouse some interest from other users, the application also sends a Facebook message to the receiver of the recommendation. This message consists of the image that the sender added to the recommendation and a link to our application in the Android PlayStore to invite the receiver and other people to download and use the app.</p> <p>. <a href=""http://chimovez.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/michael-nik-fb.png""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-803"" alt=""michael &gt; nik FB"" src=""http://chimovez.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/michael-nik-fb.png?w=530&#038;h=193"" width=""530"" height=""193"" /></a></p> <p><strong>Technical application flow </strong><br /> So our basic application flow with the emphasis on the technical aspects:</p> <ul> <li>1 Login via Facebook API</li> <li>2a New recommendation form: <ul> <li>Coordinates via GPS/ Cell tower</li> <li>Contacts via FB API</li> <li>Phonegap for taking picture</li> </ul> </li> <li>3a Submitting new recommendation: <ul> <li>Upload image to imgur.com via imgur API and receiving image url</li> <li>POST-request to add the new recommendation via the REST API</li> <li>Post message on the FB wall of the receiver of the recommendation</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>2b Interaction list: <ul> <li>GET-request for all recommendations of the current user via the REST API</li> </ul> </li> <li>3b Detail page of certain recommendation: <ul> <li>GET-request for all data (image url, text, coordinates) of the current recommendation via the REST API</li> <li>Google Maps API to show a map based on the coordinates</li> <li>GET-request for all comments of this recommendation</li> </ul> </li> <li>4b Send a new reply/comment on the current recommendation <ul> <li>POST-request to add the new comment via the REST API</li> </ul> </li> </ul> "	2013/05/08 08:41:48 PM

Because this is (clearly) after the twitter and facebook actions some of them must be from our posters. Let&#8217;s estimate 5-10 people.</li> </ul> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>In our previous post we expected 5 external clicks and 20 clicks from Facebook friends. We doubled the amount of Facebook with 40 clicks and tripled the amount of unconnected people with 18 clicks.<br /> The poster action resulted in 5 to 10 clicks which is less but normal I guess because it requires more effort to scan or type an url instead of simply clicking it when you are using your pc/smartphone/&#8230;</p> <h4>Next Post</h4> <p>The next post will be about the next iteration based on the evaluation of user behavior and comments!</p> "	2013/05/14 02:16:49 PM

You can see the evolution in the following figure of unique visitors per day generated by google analytics:</p> <p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/googleanalyticsbezoeken1.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image-150"" alt=""GoogleAnalyticsBezoeken"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/googleanalyticsbezoeken1.png?w=450"" /></a></p> <p>The two peaks match the two release dates. The first big one with the days after the unofficial release of Tip-It!, the second when we?officially?announced Tip-It! at Twitter and in the course.</p> <p>The average number of?visitors is also higher after the second release. We are now planning to &#8216;create&#8217; a third peak by the help of Facebook and a special action. More on this later in the post! <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another remarkable thing that google analytics showed us was the high bounce percentage. This percentage gives the number of users that visit your site but leave the site without doing anything. At this moment this number is 44 percent. We try to decrease this percentage by adding a preview to the login-page of our site, as you can see below. This way people may be curious and take the effort to register and discover Tip-It! Thanks to google analytics we can compare the number today with a hopefully lower number in the future.</p> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tip-it_login.png""><img class=""wp-image-165 aligncenter"" alt=""tip-it_login"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tip-it_login.png?w=378&#038;h=236"" width=""378"" height=""236"" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Via google analytics we want to investigate another issue. Do people tip sites mostly via the plug-in or via the site itself? To test this we created to?separate?submit pages where google analytics code was included. This way we can compare the how many times each submit page is executed and give an answer to our question. These results will be published later!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The last two weeks we made some final changes to our website and plugin. In the overview beneath you can see the evolution of our application. Each time three moments in the evolution are shown.

In this prototype we focused on the following functionality:</p> <ol> <li>Posting a new status;</li> <li>Viewing reply details;</li> <li>Viewing friend status updates;</li> <li>Posting a reply on a friend&#8217;s status;</li> <li>Viewing a friend&#8217;s profile.</li> </ol> <p>The following changes were made based upon the previous usability tests:</p> <ul> <li>The status (home) page has more the feel of a feed, which led to the following changes: <ul> <li>The status history was no longer necessary.</li> <li>The comments are made on the wall itself.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Similarly, the additional screen for comments in the friend&#8217;s statuses feed, was no longer required.</li> <li>The friend&#8217;s library was ommitted for now, as it was not part of the functionality that we wanted to test this time.</li> </ul> <p>The conversion to the digital prototype also imposed some limitations on the design:</p> <ul> <li>The autosuggest functionality is a work in progress;</li> <li>Limitations of the Last.fm API: as we can&#8217;t guarantee to search all of the shouts on a certain profile for certain strings, we consider statuses that correspond to shouts beyond the first 50, outdated. One alternative was to add a user preference to set how many shouts should be searched.</li> <li>To avoid adding to much complexity to the scripts already, refreshing the feeds is done manually.</li> </ul> <h2>The test setup</h2> <p>We want to see how a user performs tasks that cover the application&#8217;s functionality, as listed earlier. The user will create a status update, view friends statuses, reply to a status, and view a friend&#8217;s profile. Each of these tasks is described in more detail in <strong>table 1</strong>. We want to see if the translation from paper to digital prototype is successful: do new issues surface?</p> <p>Next we also want to find out what the user&#8217;s opinion is on the idea and usability of the application. The perceived usability can then be tested through a questionnaire.</p> <p><strong>Table 1 :</strong> list of tasks performed during the think aloud tests.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <td><strong>Nr.</strong></td> <td><strong>Task</strong></td> <td><strong>Objective</strong></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody style=""font-size:10px;""> <tr> <td>1.</td> <td>Make a new <em>status</em>: you&#8217;re looking for one or more artists similar to <em>Coldplay</em>.</td> <td> <ul> <li>Are the semantics of the term &#8216;status&#8217; clear?</li> <li>Is creating a new status easy?</li> <li>Is the result of this action as expected?</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2.</td> <td>SoundSuggest made a comment on your status. Investigate it.</td> <td> <ul> <li>Is it clear where to click?</li> <li>Is the result of this action as expected?</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.</td> <td>Find out if your friends are looking for particular music.</td> <td> <ul> <li>Are the semantics of the &#8216;Feed&#8217; button clear?</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4.</td> <td>Reply on SoundSuggest&#8217;s status.</td> <td> <ul> <li>Is it clear where to click to add a response?</li> <li>Is the result of this action as expected?</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>5.</td> <td>Check out SoundSuggest&#8217;s profile, a friend of yours.</td> <td> <ul> <li>Is it clear that you should navigate to the &#8216;friends&#8217; tab?</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>To obtain some subjective data, a SUS questionnaire has to be completed at the end of the user test. Similarly to the first iteration, this will allow also to obtain a quantitative measure for perceived usability [1] for easier comparison between versions.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p>[1] Measuring Usability, 2011, &#8220;Measuring Usability With The System Usability Scale (SUS)&#8221;, <a href=""http://www.measuringusability.com/sus.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.measuringusability.com/sus.php</a></p> "	2013/05/18 12:45:03 AM

Also no additional messages are possible yet. This was not clear, unless this was pointed out to the test users.</li> <li>Once it was clear that you could only add artists, what sometimes posed a problem was that it was not clear that the artist name had to be correct, and there was little feedback as when it wasn&#8217;t. Other than that, creating a post was fairly easy.</li> <li>To a certain extent yes; the page refreshes automatically when posting a new shout, so the effect action is clear, but one issue arises though: the order of shouts doesn&#8217;t seem to be chronological.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ul> <li>Most of the users knew fairly quickly that they needed to refresh the feed first.

The professor invited some extra (external) people to listen along which made it even more pleasant.</p> <p>Starting with team LPG, we were in for 5 hours of presentations. And unlike what we expected, these 5 hours were over in a flash.</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><em><strong>General remarks</strong></em></span></p> <p>Our biggest remark is that most groups made a &#8216;trip report.&#8217; By this we mean that they began with their paper prototype, and than discussed their development iteration by iteration. But this does not seem the best approach to us. We discussed some aspects of the app throughout the entire development, making it more clear to the listeners (we think).</p> <p>Another issue with the iteration by iteration approach is that is boring to listen to, especially when even the smallest issue is discussed for every iteration. We had a hard time paying attention during this phase of every presentation.</p> <p>The movies shown by the groups were nice looking and way more fancy that the video we made. They would do a great job as promo video. But we think not all of them worked that well as demo video. The catchy promo video&#8217;s do not always give a clear view of how to use the app. For the demo in our presentation, we chose for a very basic video that showed the 2 main functionalities of our app. I think every attendant had a clear view of how to use our app after viewing the video, but correct me if i&#8217;m wrong! A live demo, like JeTS-CHI did,? is also a good way of presenting the app to the audience we think.</p> <p><em><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><strong>Individual feedback</strong></span></em></p> <p><strong> CHInterest/Recotweet </strong><br /> The twitter style app is a nice idea and the marketing campaign seemed pretty original!</p> <p><strong> Hatchi/UAdvise </strong><br /> The theme of books, movies and TV Series is well integrated and seems really usable! The app has an inviting lay-out!</p> <p><strong> Team LPG/Xplorer </strong><br /> To us this felt like an elegant foursquare without all superfluous crap. This can be seen as an advantage, but as a disadvantage as well. Try to give the app a clear identity and find out who uses the app and why!</p> <p><strong> ChiMovez/LocSha </strong><br /> Unbeatalbe team in terms of programming/integration. To bad that this course has an other focus point.</p> <p><strong> Team S-chi/Tip-it </strong><br /> This applications seems usable and useful right away! The plug-in is a nice add-on to enhance the simplicity of an (already elegant) website.</p> <p><strong> Team TGV/ShareShark </strong><br /> The Ask/Search recommendations is a functionality that really distinguishes this app from all the rest!</p> <p><strong> Joris S./RX.fm </strong><br /> Obviouly the unlucky one of this course, but made the best of it with the limited time he had!</p> <p><strong> JeTS-chi/Recommend-Thing.com </strong><br /> The website makes good use of the large screen. This large screen fits the kind of application they choose well.</p> "	2013/05/26 10:13:15 PM

Some students conformed this concern by saying the application felt more like a frituur-search engine rather than a frituur-recommending system.</p> <p>2) We often got the feedback that it would be nice to expand this application to work for any kind of fastfood. Today we got an interesting perspective on that suggestion: it might be ok to just focus on frituren alone, but nothing about the app seems to be frituur specific. Either we should keep the application general and expand it other types of fastfood, or we could keep it focused but actually do something with that theme. For example, we could add a &#8220;bicky burger price comparison&#8221; tool.</p> <p>If you happen to (dis)agree with the above feedback, feel free to leave a comment and share your thoughts!</p> "	2013/05/21 08:03:37 PM

This way we never had to ask to do a specific task, but also made it harder to tell how they would use the application normally.</p> <h3>Results:</h3> <p>All 3 users had remarks about the sliders. One of them said he expected numbers on a slider. Another one explicitly said that it&#8217;s not really a slider since it has only 3 options.They all tried to give some alternatives, like using radio buttons or just 3 actual buttons. None of them were really convinced about &#8220;the best&#8221; way to do it though.</p> <p>One user had a remark about the alignment, which wasn&#8217;t perfect only because we quickly created it in powerpoint by dragging everything to where it should be.</p> <p>None of the users experienced any trouble with creating a new recommendation except for one that didn&#8217;t follow the order in which he entered the data for the recommendation. This only caused problems because of the way we implemented this in powerpoint, it would not be a problem in a fully working version.</p> <p>We actually had to give that explanation quite often during the test: &#8220;This button/click/filter/&lt;insert other functionality&gt; doesn&#8217;t really do what you expect here just because how limited the implementation in powerpoint is. Please pretend that this shows &lt;insert correct thing to be shown&gt; or please pretend that you clicked that recommendation and that you thus see more information about that one.&#8221;</p> <p>We thus decided that the combination of our lacking powerpoint implementation with the nature of our test wasn&#8217;t really going to work. Because the remaining time for the course was rather limited as well we then chose to create a fully functional version of our application that would have only the very basic functionalities required to use the app. These functionalities are:</p> <ul> <li>creating a recommendation</li> <li>showing more information about a recommendation</li> <li>showing the list with received and sent recommendations</li> <li>the basic filters for &#8220;from me&#8221; and &#8220;to me&#8221;, not the advanced filters</li> </ul> 	2013/05/23 04:59:45 PM

This means that the implementation was very limited to what was actually possible. We had 4 versions of our main screen. One showing some received and previously sent recommendations. One showing only received recommendations. One with a bigger version of a recommendation showing more details (this would be shown if the user clicks a received one). And the last one that would show the recommendation that the user just created.</p> <p>The main screen looks like this:</p> <p><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/main.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-227"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/main.png?w=650"" width=""500"" height=""272"" /></a></p> <p>It should be noted that only the &#8220;to me&#8221; check box actually did something here, since we did not make a separate screen for the &#8220;from me&#8221; button. Besides that we also had a screen for creating a new recommendation and one for the advanced filters:</p> <p><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/newreco.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-234"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/newreco.png?w=650"" width=""499"" height=""272"" /></a></p> <p><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/filters.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-235"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/filters.png?w=650"" width=""500"" height=""272"" /></a></p> <p>In this last screen the sliders actually did change position and changed the explanation underneath them depending on where the new position of the slider. We were hoping this extra explanation would show a bit better what the slider actually means, since this was a problem in the previous iterations.</p> <p>The actual results of this iteration can be found in the following blog post.</p> "	2013/05/23 04:59:46 PM

We will do this by itemising some thoughts:</p> <p>* First of all, the lectures were intensive (long duration), but there was a nice alternation between working moments and moments of watching related videos. On the other hand, it was good to do some little presentation, but by listening to all the presentations of the other teams, a lot of time was not used efficiently. It would have been better to just work on the application, because a lot of teams still had a lot of work to do to go live with their app.</p> <p>* The total amount of study points does certainly match with the amount of working load. You have to spend around 120 hours to achieve the goal.</p> <p>* It was difficult to get started. The abstract assignment was given and within an hour we had to know the subject of our application. This is too less time to get up with an idea that differentiates your app with the existing applications. You also have to work on it for a whole semester, so you should better think twice about your subject.</p> <p>* Blogging is a nice way of reporting about the work you&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s less boring than writing a report and you can follow the progress of other teams.</p> <p>* Twittering (and also blogging) was an added value in the beginning of the course. But its activity went down for a lot of teams when reaching the end of the course.</p> <p>* We did not take the badge-system as a motivation. The result of the application is more important that trying to earn new badges.</p> <p>* The course is not only about where to put graphical elements, but it is also about how and why a user makes use of the application (statistics). If a user does not use a certain functionality, it&#8217;s not worth doing a lot of tests for the functionality. This should have been stressed earlier in the course.</p> <p>* Very nice is the atmosphere within the HCI-group. The distance between the participants and the assistants/professor is very small.</p> <p>* People should certainly take this course if they are interested in the user-interaction of applications. They should also not be afraid to communicate with possible users and to ask for their thoughts.</p> 	2013/05/24 06:41:57 PM

We did notice that the problem with the search function came back a lot, but it was solved eventually. They had only little information about the analytics of their app, but they did make use of questionnaires which allowed to them to graph the improvement.</p> <h3>ChiMoves u2013 LocSha</h3> <p>They made use of the Play Store, which excludes iOS users. They also had limited data about the usage, but they did have more detailed info on the active installations.</p> <h3>Chi Con Carne u2013 FrietLeuven</h3> <p>They had a very nice app, detailed usage statistics via Google Analytics. In the beginning there were some video troubles.?They also had a very clear overview of the different iterations.</p> <h3>Team S-CHI u2013 Tip-it</h3> <p>Team S-CHI marked the problems directly on the prototype, which immediately made very clear where the problems were. They made an overview of the different changes over all the iterations, which was a bit redundant as the changes were already mentioned in each iteration separately.</p> <h3>Team TGV u2013 ShareShark</h3> <p>Team TGV showed a changelog with the changes to their application. They used a lot of different stores to make their app available.</p> <h3>JeTS-chi u2013 Recommend-thing</h3> <p>JeTS-chi made a somewhat strange requirement of 15u201d screens. Any screen size from tablet up to laptop and desktop seemed suited enough for using the app. They limited usage data to the amount of recommendations. They used no video but a live demo, which is a nice difference to the other teams. But they had some trouble with this demo, so it might have been better to just show to video to avoid such presentation-time problems.</p> 	2013/05/25 03:14:42 PM

In addition, it&#8217;s rather easy to implement these changes, but before doing so, it would take more user evaluations to check for?instance?if?users don&#8217;t just want to delete?their own requests, but their suggestions as well.</p> <p>Remark 2 is something we don&#8217;t consider at the moment. It doesn&#8217;t fit with the other types of entertainment?the app?supports: series, movies and books are more <em>time-consuming </em>compared to a song of a few minutes.?It doesn&#8217;t feel right to wait?a day, for instance, for a friend to reply to?your music request,?as it?would take just a few minutes to listen to that?recommended song. Also, it&#8217;s more common to associate artists with a song rather than genres, so music has less common ground with series, movies and books.</p> <p><em>Google Analytics</em></p> <ol> <li>Some persons might find it intimidating to log in with their Facebook account. Possible reasons:<br /> - doubting the?way their passwords are handled;<br /> - afraid to get their Facebook wall spammed.</li> <li>While we think it&#8217;s clear what the app does, it might scare users who don&#8217;t know what the <em>suggest</em>?and<em>?request </em>buttons (image 2) do. Rather than exploring the app, they choose to leave. A possible solution could be to show a very short tutorial the first time a user logs in.</li> <li>These numbers (see results) lie within the range of expectation. Approximately 66% look at the activity stream first before suggesting or requesting something themselves. The <em>suggest</em>?and<em>?request </em>buttons are used equally.</li> <li>While?inviting friends via Facebook?could help spreading the word about the app, people choose not to proceed and as such not?post the?invitational message?on Facebook. We expect, as stated at &#8217;1.&#8217;, that it feels to them?like they are spamming their friend&#8217;s Facebook wall. More evaluations should be conducted to find more specific motivations behind this restraint and possible solutions.</li> </ol> <p><em>Questionnaire</em></p> <p>The median of all questionnaires of iteration 4 is 86.25. This is a small improvement over iterations 3&#8242;s 85. However,?note that the lowest score of iteration 4 (image 3) is considerably lower than those of iterations 2 and 3. The main reason for this result is that during iteration 4,?approximately 90% was between the ages of 15 and 20, with no computer science background, while for iteration 2 and 3, about 90% was between the ages of 20 and 25 with a computer science background.</p> <p><em>General conclusion</em></p> <p>Looking back at the way of?attracting more users, it seems the more personal the approach is, the higher the success rate is to get a new user. As such, the posters spread across several public places were the least effective (and most expensive) method of gathering new users. <a title=""uAdvise on Facebook"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/UAdvise/517394514974045"" target=""_blank"">Our Facebook</a> and, more importantly, <a title=""uAdviseApp on Twitter"" href=""https://twitter.com/uAdviseApp"" target=""_blank"">our Twitter?messages</a>?attracted quite some attention, leading for instance to?an?increase of?the number of viewers of <a title=""uAdvise - The Movie"" href=""http://bit.ly/uadvisemov"" target=""_blank"">our short video on YouTube</a>. However, it wasn&#8217;t very effective in getting more new users. Mailing and asking people in person to use the app had the highest success rate.</p> "	2013/05/26 12:08:46 AM

Then, we let them do as they pleased. The data we would be getting were the survey, consisting of a<strong> SUS test</strong> and two<strong> free-form feedback/suggestions</strong> questions, together with the<strong> usage logs</strong>. A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_usability_scale""><strong>S</strong>ystem <strong>U</strong>sability <strong>S</strong>cale</a> test is a standardised 10 question multiple choice test used for assessing the usability of a system, where &#8216;system&#8217; can refer to anything that has a user interface. SUS tests are handy to compare different iterations to each other (not applicable in this case) and to check whether there is a problem, but not for what that problem would be. For that reason we also included the free-form questions.</p> <p>Using this test method, the test persons would feel minimal pressure while testing and reviewing the application, which we think resulted in honest and realistic results.</p> <h4>Results</h4> <p>Despite having an ok SUS score (77.1, the average for any SUS test is 68) one question in particular did not receive a good response: &#8220;I think that I would like to use this system frequently.&#8221; The reason for this was apparent from the free-form questions; 6 out of 10 users indicated that they had no need for our website, existing social media websites (mostly Facebook) were already good enough. Furthermore 4 out of 10 users said they did not have a Twitter-account (and presumably wouldn&#8217;t want to make one just for this).</p> <p>The solutions is one we earlier said we planned to do but didn&#8217;t because of time-constraints: Facebook and Google login. It takes care of the second large concern and by making the website available to users of these social media websites we further emphasize what we think is the largest benefit of using Recommend Thing: <strong>having all your recommendations in one place</strong>.</p> <h4>Solutions</h4> <p>Some lesser concerns are already addressed as well in the version that is now online</p> <ul> <li>Some users wanted to see more clearly to/from whom a recommendation was, we solved this by adding the user avatars</li> <li>Nearly no one made recommendations to multiple people, &#8220;Add contact&#8221; was changed to &#8220;Add contacts&#8221;</li> <li>Usage logs showed that nobody even tried to invite another users, so we made the invite option in the &#8220;Add contacts&#8221; menu more visible</li> </ul> <p>It would be nice to know how these changes influenced user behaviour. Sadly, no JeTS-CHI team members will be having time to figure this out in the coming weeks due to exams.</p> <p>Please try <a href=""http://recommend-thing.com"">Recommend Thing</a> for yourself and <a href=""http://jetschi.wordpress.com/recommend-thing/feedback/"">tell us what you think</a>!</p> "	2013/05/26 12:03:44 PM

We learned that it is truly a different way of developing than what we were used to, like in a lot more iterations.</li> <li>It&#8217;s only by trying, that you can learn how to test an application on its users. Now we see that some tactics we chose in the beginning were maybe not the best decisions. But we learned from our mistakes. For example: Deciding to strip down our app to the bare minimum, and relying on the advise of the users which features to add: this leads to an app that has several well known and popular features, but it does not make a great app. A well thought-of concept makes an app stand out, look at ChiConCarne&#8217;s app! We learned in this course that we have to listen to the users, but we as developers still have the last word. <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </li> <li>Working with blogs and Twitter is a good way to learn from each other. In the beginning there was some doubt about the system but actually it should be used more often for project courses.</li> <li>The attempt to go &#8216;into the wild&#8217; was also fun because this was ?the first time. While you would think only 10 people would take a look at it, it is nice to see a lot more 80 visitors if you make the effort of promoting it.</li> </ul> "	2013/05/26 07:40:45 PM

It was certainly an experience to work with paper prototypes and to see how fast usability problems can be found in the early stages of development. It was also good to develop something from another point of view, this pointed out to us that some things might feel logical to us but are far from logical for the people that eventually should use the app.</p> <p>The five and a half hour sessions did discourage us a bit before we started the course. But in the end it wasn&#8217;t that long, probably because of the interactivity of the classes. And this format is certainly better than splitting the course into multiple classes/week.</p> <p>We think this course was a great introduction to the &#8216;human&#8217; side of computer science.</p> 	2013/05/26 07:40:54 PM

A few remarks that were made at the end of the presentation:</p> <ul> <li>It is always the same text that makes the artist names get clipped in the statuses on the home screen? <br /><em>This issue should be resolved when it becomes possible to add custom messages. Also, the layout used for the statuses is a built-in one by jQuery Mobile. In a next iteration this could be customized so that all text will be visible on multiple lines.</em></li> <li>Why do you feel the application was not ready to be introduced into an app store, or spread among a larger number of users? <br /><em>I felt that before the last iteration, there were still some significant issues that needed addressing to ensure a certain level of quality. Using short development cycles with a limited amount of test users, made it possible to incrementally improve the application at a relatively fast tempo. Applying techniques such as usage tracking, might not have given the same level of detail as users tend to be less willing to give feedback compared to face-to-face evaluations. I assume this would be a risk especially when the application usage is low. On the other hand, in terms of recommendation trust, the application did provide an additional functionality by combining Last.fm&#8217;s recommendations with perhaps more compelling recommendation by peers.</em></li> </ul> <p><iframe src='http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/21931753' width='450' height='369' style='border:1px'></iframe> <div style=""margin-bottom:5px;""> <strong> <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/jorisschelfaut/gebruikersinterfaces-presentation-20130521"" title=""Gebruikersinterfaces presentation 2013-05-21"" target=""_blank"">Gebruikersinterfaces presentation 2013-05-21</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/jorisschelfaut"" target=""_blank"">jorisschelfaut</a></strong> </div> <h2>Other presentations</h2> <hr /> <h3><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/chiconcarne_20120521_final_presentation.ppt"" target=""_blank"">Presentation</a> by <a href=""http://chiconcarne.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chiconcarne</a> : <a href=""http://frietleuven.be/"" target=""_blank"">Frietleuven</a></h3> <p>Overall a good presentation with nice slides. (Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to hear Alex&#8217;s sped up voice, which he assured me, would have been very funny.) I heard a lot of people complaining about it becoming some sort of search engine, but that doesn&#8217;t really seem like a big issue to me. Perhaps their search engine for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friterie"" target=""_blank"">frietkoten</a> is just very usable. You can&#8217;t expect to recreate <a href=""http://pinterest.com/"" target=""_blank"">pinterest</a> for any concept you like and expect it to work as you planned.</p> <p>A lot of teams had some fancy Google analytics data, but it struck me that often it turned out that it was very hard to draw actual conclusions from this data in terms of usability. However in their presentation they also showed data of button/functionality usage which was much more revealing. As they were able to identify unused features, they were able to much more targeted user tests.</p> <p>If I can make any remarks &#8211; perhaps it would have been nice to include <a href=""http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/existing.htm"" target=""_blank"">evaluations of existing systems</a> as a benchmark for the Frietleuven app. As they pointed out in the question round, there already exist certain websites and tools such as <a href=""http://www.just-eat.be/"" target=""_blank"">just-eat.be</a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/pakfriet/id555639045?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">Pakfriet</a>. However, this is probably a remark I could give on any of the projects.</p> <p>Another remark, although this is rather a suggestion for &#8220;future work&#8221;, is that &#8211; considering their target audience are new students, i.e., students that are not from Louvain &#8211; adding an additional language option may prove useful, as there are a <a href=""http://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/40000_students"" target=""_blank"">significant amount of foreign students</a> at <a href=""http://www.kuleuven.be/english"">KULeuven</a> university.</p> <p>Read more on their presentation <a href=""http://chiconcarne.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/slideshow/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p> <hr /> <h3><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/sandervoeten/eindpresentatie-chi-final?ref=http://chimovez.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Presentation</a> by <a href=""http://chimovez.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chimovez</a> : <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.kuleuven.chi13.chimovez"" target=""_blank"">LocSha</a></h3> <p>Overall, I think their presentation and application were good. Some people complained that the app was only for Android platforms. However, it is very reasonable to focus on one platform to create a working prototype that is ready for testing, instead of loosing a lot of time to test perhaps a few more users on a different platform (basically, you&#8217;re still testing the same user interface). Perhaps they lack a particular motivation for choosing Android. For example, given that Android still has the largest <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/android-accounts-for-75-percent-market-share-windows-phone-leapfrogs-blackberry-7000015496/"" target=""_blank"">market share</a> in mobile platforms, finding test users for that particular platform is likely to be easier.</p> <p>One of the people in the audience asked if they would distinguish their app from the dozens that are already out there &#8211; or even within the scope of this class, as another group had a pretty similar idea. Again, evaluations of existing applications could be a great help. On the other hand, you&#8217;d be lucky if a brainstorm of an hour produces the next Facebook, iPad, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliced_bread"" target=""_blank"">sliced bread</a>. Ideas usually take some time to grow before you can reap the rewards.</p> <p><em>On a side note, the person that asked the question, was a professor in sociology (as far as I can recall). From what we learned in the course, usability in HCI is a very broad field of study, where the computers aren&#8217;t always the point of focus. Instead, psychological and sociological aspects tend to have a big influence as well, and of course, the species of computer scientists is usually not briefed on all of the details.</em></p> <p>A general remark perhaps was the lack of heuristic approaches. A set of guidelines that I found for handheld devices is for example a <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.87.5230"" target=""_blank"">paper by Gong and Tarasewich</a>. An interesting idea for next year&#8217;s course is perhaps to use data from the students&#8217; projects to verify certain heuristics.</p> <p>Check out Chimovez incredibly awesome post about their presentation <a href=""http://chimovez.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/slides-final-presentation-210513/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> &#8211; I will not be held responsible if you are dissapointed.</p> <hr /> <h3><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/finalpresentation.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Presentation</a> by <a href=""http://chinterest.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chinterest</a> : <a href=""http://radix.ua.ac.be/~p080818/Login.html"" target=""_blank"">Recotweet</a></h3> <p>This was the first group that presented their project &#8211; <em>kudos</em> for that. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t recall too many questions that were asked at the end.</p> <p>One of the things I do remember is their anonymous recommendation system. An example they gave about usage of their application was that some users used &#8220;Movie Fans&#8221; as a recipient, for example seeing it as some sort of community. This illustrates professor Duval&#8217;s comment during one of the lectures: <em>when designing a path through a field, sit back and relax and wait until a number of people have crossed the field, while tracking their movements. At the end of the day you would have a good idea of how the paths optimal trajectory</em>. Users often find their own way in an application and tend to be quite effective at finding an application&#8217;s strengths, again referring to the <em>Frietleuven</em> app.</p> <p>From this perspective, some ideas for future implementations are perhaps to make the recipients in the list of tweets clickable to browse related tweets in an &#8220;anonymous&#8221; channel, and it would also be nice to have an overview of communities and to be a able to subscribe to these channels or tags.</p> <p>Check out the post on their presentation <a href=""http://chinterest.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/final-result/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p> <hr /> <h3><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/Hatchi13/presentatie-uadvise?ref=http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/presentation/"" target=""_blank"">Presentation</a> by <a href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hatchi13</a> : <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/UAdvise/517394514974045?fref=ts"" target=""_blank"">uAdvise</a></h3> <p>One of the issues that was discussed in the question round, was that their app did not support multiple genre tags. The reason they did so, was that the goal of the app was recommendation, not the notorious search engine functionality we have heard of before. This strikes me as a little odd, as it seems to me that multiple tags would allow for more fine-grained recommendations. Still, I don&#8217;t think this is a real usability issue in the end, making it less of a priority.</p> <p>Check out the post on their presentation <a href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/presentation/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p> <hr /> <h3><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/SimonChuptys/jetschi"" target=""_blank"">Presentation</a> by <a href=""http://jetschi.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">JeTS-CHI</a> : <a href=""http://recommend-thing.com/"" target=""_blank"">Recommend-thing</a></h3> <p>There was some controversy about the 15&#8243; screen limitation.

Chimovez&#8217;s application). It seemed the idea behind the application was to build an &#8220;application that allows you to recommend places to your Facebook friends&#8221;. The actual users however, wanted to recommend basically anything that was somehow related to places.

Considering the fact that no team was way better or worse than other teams, we think it&#8217;s best to list a few more general remarks:</p> <ul> <li>It&#8217;s interesting that while we all got the same subject (recommending something to someone), in the end, there were 9 very different ideas.</li> <li>No presentation was bad or uninteresting.</li> <li>Not a single question was asked to place a team in a pejorative context,?though very few questions seemed to?be slightly farfetched, but that&#8217;s probably just a matter?of interpretation. Most importantly, it&#8217;s nice to see that?the lion share of all questions showed genuine interest in other team&#8217;s presentations and apps.</li> <li>A?remark we do?have about some presentations is that it would be interesting to show?a bit more about the ideas and bigger decisions?behind the app like: storyboard, why (not) mobile app, parts of the design process that were more difficult to execute,&#8230; Although, we do realize that there&#8217;s only a limited amount of time and it&#8217;s not possible to tell about everything during the final presentation.</li> <li>Finally, while it&#8217;s interesting to see usage numbers of the apps, like data gathered with Google Analytics, it helps putting them in context by saying during what time period this data was gathered. This way, it could be possible to?notice trends and see if a certain?change?leads to more or less users, for instance.</li> </ul> <p>Overall, keeping the amount of development and design freedom in mind, it&#8217;s really something that all teams were able to create apps of such a high quality.</p> 	2013/05/27 12:00:00 AM

In that sense, there may very well never has been an elephant in the room to begin with. Nevertheless, we feel it&#8217;s a refreshing approach to have such a limited amount of theory before we&#8217;re able to get started. It&#8217;s a bit like learning how to drive a car: it&#8217;s not that much about the theory, it&#8217;s about the techniques.</p> <p>Having said that, initially, it was hard to know when to shift from the first iteration to the next or what even an iteration was supposed to be, so it was a satisfactory <em>aha moment</em> when we saw slides 8 and 9 of <a title=""Presentation"" href=""http://www.slideshare.net/erik.duval/20130326-chi-sessie4"" target=""_blank"">this presentation</a>.

What was noticeable, what we learned and whatu2019s important for us to keep remembering.</p> <h3>Creating an application</h3> <p>The most important thing that we learned is to take the completely different viewpoint from the user into account. The user of an application doesnu2019t think like the developer of that application. And no matter how the user thinks, heu2019s always right. This means that you as developer should adapt your application to fit the user. It should never be the other way around, i.e. the user adapting himself to the application.</p> <p>Another important thing is that you can keep trying to improve your application more and more, but anyone will at some point need users to test and improve the user interface. You cannot make a good interface without testing with users. The issues with opening the <a href=""http://one.laptop.org"">OLPC</a> illustrates the importance of everything said above.</p> <p>Further it is also necessary that you do multiple iterations to improve the design. You canu2019t write the perfect application from scratch. It will need improvements (for which you will test with users), and you will need to test those improvements (again with users) to see if they were effective. Designing a good user interface is thus an iterative process in which you keep testing and improving the interface.</p> <h3>Getting test users</h3> <p>We also experienced some problems in getting enough test users to thoroughly test our application. People in our environment, like friends and family, were willing enough, but at some point we had to get out of that circle, to get results from people who don&#8217;t have any bias. (Friends and family tend to be a little kinder about problems they encounter with things you&#8217;ve made).</p> <p>Getting those extra users &#8216;in the wild&#8217; proved extremely hard. Even with the contest we set up, to give the users an incentive for really using our app, we only got around 80 unique visitors to use our app. If we would&#8217;ve had more time, we might have experienced with some other techniques to get more users.</p> <h3>About the set-up of the course</h3> <p>To start with, we think 5,5h session are loooong. On one hand this is useful, because we really got things done when we worked on the project for so long at once. But on the other hand, concentration gets lost very easily near the end of the session.</p> <p>Another option would be two session a week, both taken up 3h or so, but it might be hard to get do everything that has to be done together (like giving those little presentations, brainstorming-storyboarding-prototyping, ..) in a 3h session.</p> <p>Finally, we liked the fact that the reports were replaced by the tweeting and blogging. This gives you the possibility to keeping track of yourself and the other teams and also to react to and get feedback from other teams (and from the professor and his assistants as well).</p> "	2013/05/27 02:32:21 AM

The teaching strategy consisted mainly out of presentations with slides, some video material and supervised exercises to put theory into practice. The blog served as a means for self-reflection and combined with Twitter, as a communication channel between students and teaching staff.</p> <p>In a paper by Petkovic et al. [1] a similar teaching strategy is applied for course on software engineering, although apart from usability aspects there was also a strong focus on software quality. Some of the results presented in this paper were the following:</p> <ul> <li>&#8220;The focus of the class was on methods, processes, teamwork, communication and design for usability, and not on software architectures or programming techniques&#8221; [1]. Petkovic et al. indicate that it was important to stress this at the beginning of the course [1]. In the <em>UIs</em> course this was indeed made clear from the beginning: the applications will be not be graded in terms of software quality.<br /> <br /> Still, many of the teams spent significant time to develop the back-end of their applications. Perhaps some additional guidance in this area would be welcome for future projects. Perhaps promoting groups to work with the same user database would also help, this might increase the usage of the applications as test users wouldn&#8217;t need new login data to test each separate prototype.</li> <li>An interesting perspective that is used in [1] is that instructors take on the role of &#8220;management, tech leads, and users&#8221;. In the course <em>UIs</em> this was also the case, although I feel the course lacks some of the more managerial aspects. Most of the projects lack some concrete &#8220;vision&#8221;. This might have caused the relatively low usage of the apps. Differentiating an application among the thousands that are out there on the market is not easy, and perhaps I would have hoped that from the teaching staff&#8217;s experience over the years, there would have been more feedback in that department. This is probably reflected as well in the variety of approaches by students to spread their applications.</li> <li>&#8220;Grading policies should reflect and encourage adherence to software engineering methods, group interaction and iterations, and not be based only on the final delivery&#8221; [1]. Intriguingly, they claim that students would actually have been less motivated if their interactions would have been graded. I assume that the badge system and quantified self methods may form the middleground in this discussion, although results of that study will probably provide insight.</li> </ul> <p>All in all I think the idea behind the course is good. The course material is perhaps rather limited. Of course students can find theoretical sources, books, websites, papers et cetera anywhere online nowadays, but more concrete references to this kind of material would be welcome. What the course material lacks most, are perhaps much more concrete examples, simple as well as real applications of techniques. Reading about a recipe is still something else as seeing someone make it, but perhaps Jeroen Meus&#8217;s success is actually built on a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-1JCpAV3g"" target=""_blank"">tasty accent and hand gestures</a>.</p> <p>[1] Dragutin Petkovic, Gary Thompson, and Rainer Todtenhoefer. 2006.

Each group prepared a couple of tasks to be executed by another group. By observing the time and effort it takes to perform the given tasks, we can evaluate the ease of use of pinterest. </p> <p><img src=""http://teamtgv.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/med_funny-cat.jpg?w=229"" style=""height:120px;"" class=""alignright"" />The first task we composed was to find a funny picture of a cat. The evaluation started when the user was logged in and looking at the main page. At first, the user clicked on the category named &#8220;animals&#8221; but none of the displayed pictures contained a funny cat. After a few seconds, the person decided to use the search function with the term &#8220;funny cat&#8221; and immediately found the kind of picture he was looking for. This gives us the information that the search function is a very intuitive way to find a specific pin and it didn&#8217;t take long for the subject to find the requested image.</p> <p>The next assignment was to share a picture of a certain person named Sarah Dunleavy. The first action of the user was to enter the given name in the search box, which led him to the results page which didn&#8217;t contain any result. However, the user didn&#8217;t notice that the page had fully loaded and mistakenly thought that the page was still loading. After a minute, he tried to look for the first name only but this didn&#8217;t give any info related to the user he was looking for. Only then, he noticed that the results page had an option to display search results for pins, boards and pinners. After selecting the third option, the subject immediately found the person Sarah Dunleavy and fluently shared one of her images. This tells us that the different search options aren&#8217;t as obvious as they should be. Another thing to notice is that it is not clear if no results are found, because our user thought that the page was still loading. On the other hand, sharing a pin didn&#8217;t cause any problems and was very straightforward to do.</p> <p><img src=""http://www.healthconnect.be/sites/default/files/resources/support-1.jpg"" style=""height:100px;"" class=""alignleft"" />The following task was to find a way to send a mail to the support team of Pinterest. The first action of the user was to click on the &#8220;About&#8221; link at the top of the page and then he immediately went to the page about the Pinterest team. After about ten seconds of searching, he couldn&#8217;t find a possibility to mail the support so he clicks on the help link. On the help page, our user selects the &#8220;contacting&#8221; topic and gets an explanation of the mail function. However, a real option to send a mail is still not available. Another minute of random link browsing eventually leads to the page to report bugs which contains an option to send a mail. With this information we can conclude that it is easy to find an explanation of the email function but it&#8217;s hard to find the actual email function itself. It could be indicated more clearly that a user has to open a subject first, before the email function is accessible.</p> <p>At last, our user was instructed to create a secret board about art. Still in the help section, the user clicks on the main logo to return to the homepage of Pinterest. He then clicks the &#8220;Add&#8221; button and selects the option to create a new board. Altogether this only took about 20 seconds. This indicates that it is very straightforward and intuitive to create a new board. The required options like making the board secret are conveniently presented to the user.</p> <p>With these observations, we can conclude that new users easily get accustomed to Pinterest as long as they don&#8217;t have a problem and need to mail the support. The user of the &#8220;Add&#8221; button is very straightforward and doesn&#8217;t require any extra explanation. Searching for a certain keyword is also easy but the option to search for a board or user instead of a pin can be displayed more clearly. Along with this information, we learned that this way of evaluating an interface is a very effective and efficient way to gather information about the design of a user interface and we will certainly be applying it in our next assignments. However, we must keep in mind that the quality of the evaluation depends on the amount and diversity of the tasks that we give to our test audience.</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:10 PM

We tried to evaluate the User Interface of the <a title=""pinterest"" href=""http://pinterest.com"">http://pinterest.com</a> website. We were divided into different groups.</p> <p>Each group had to think of a series of tests to be executed by another group. Although we already had some time to check out the pinterest website (and therefore the tests could be a bit biased) there were still some issues to be found with the website when conducting the tests. We used the following tests to see if there were some issues to be found, each test is followed by our observations and, if applicable, ?by a possible solution.</p> <ul> <li>Create a board that would serve the purpose of grouping everything of a specific interest of the user.</li> </ul> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">This worked great. The user had no issues whatsoever. The user easily found the button to add a board via the Add-popup.</p> <ul> <li>Add a Pin to the previously created board that the user could find on the website.</li> </ul> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">The user found the pin of its interest easily by selecting the category of his interest. However when trying to pin the Pin of his interest to the board there were some issues. The user scrolled down and up to look for the button to pin it to his board. This button is called the repin button and it seems that the concept is not clear to a first time user. Maybe this could be clearer by just stating what it does i.e. pin to board.</p> <ul> <li>Add a Pin from an external website to the previously created board.</li> </ul> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">There were no issues here.</p> <ul> <li>Search for any available mobile apps for the website.</li> </ul> <p style=""padding-left:30px;"">This was a big problem! The user could not find the page he was looking for. One would think that Pinterest would like users to incorporate Pinterest in their daily lives by using the smartphone app on the go. However there was no clear indication that such an app existed. There was one page that stated that there was an iOS and Android app available but it was very hard to find. The user would land on the page if he clicked on the &#8220;pin it button&#8221;-link in the about menu. Which in my opinion has nothing to do with a mobile app. This became clear when the user did the test, he first clicked the Pinterest logo to go to the home page. Afterwards he clicked the ?category, account settings, business links. Each of these clicks are followed by a huge amount of scrolling to look for an indication for a smartphone app. Finally the user clicked the correct link. To make this clearer I would include a small android and iOS logo in the top bar or include a smartphone button in the about menu.</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:16 PM

It&#8217;s just as simple as that. A brainstorm offers the?perfect opportunity to gather lots of ideas on what can be incorporated into the project and it provides a moment of reflection on what basically are the foundations of the project as well. No propositions are off-limits and not a single idea gets shot off. And that right there&#8217;s the difficult part of a brainstorm. It takes quite some practice and lip-biting self-control to not express doubts on some ideas right off the bat, even if it&#8217;s more than obvious that the execution of some propositions won&#8217;t ever see the light of day due to time constraints, for example.</p> <p>Applied to our brainstorm about an application with the main idea being <em>&#8216;someone recommending something to someone&#8217;</em>, we were able to get quite a large collection of ideas, as depicted in the photo below. The ideas we came up with can be divided very roughly into two?aspects:</p> <ul> <li>the human aspect, including the ability to share recommendations with friends and having some kind of grading system to track &#8216;good&#8217; recommendations;</li> <li>the recommending aspect, being a collection of everything that&#8217;s possible to recommend to someone, like a movie, an activity or a location.</li> </ul> <div id=""attachment_37"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 530px""><a href=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstorm.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-37"" alt=""The notes taken during our brainstorm"" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstorm.jpg?w=520&#038;h=515"" width=""520"" height=""515"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The notes taken during our brainstorm</p></div> <p>A brainstorm&#8217;s all good and dandy, but in the end, it has no meaning at all if the difference between everything the application <em>could</em> do and everything it <em>should</em> do isn&#8217;t made. In an ideal world, an application could be created that is able to do everything and give the user the possibility to recommend anything he wants. Alas, we don&#8217;t live in an ideal world. Development time is limited and wanting to do too many things could make the application too complex and distract from what truly is important: a good user interface design.</p> <p>If a brainstorm could be compared to the body of a human being, its spirit would be represented by the storyboard.

Hard to imagine? Try surfing to <a title=""Pinterest"" href=""http://www.pinterest.com"" target=""_blank"">Pinterest</a>. Pinterest jumps on the social network bandwagon with this simple, but potentially addicting concept. However, the process of getting familiarised with this site is not exactly a bed of roses. Spending about an hour on Pinterest evaluating the user interface and observing the behaviour of other persons using the site led to following conclusions.</p> <div id=""attachment_11"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 530px""><a href=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chaos.png""><img class=""size-large wp-image-11"" alt=""The page the user gets to see after logging in."" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chaos.png?w=520&#038;h=242"" width=""520"" height=""242"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The page the user gets to see after logging in.</p></div> <p>At first sight, new users could feel a bit overwhelmed by the amount of pictures being shown. It certainly doesn&#8217;t help that they are obliged to choose at least five interests. That means tough luck for the user if he is (initially) only interested in two or three things. Also, the randomness of displaying pictures of chosen interests and the inability to easily reorganise these pictures make the screen look a bit chaotic. Uninteresting images could be cluttering the upper part of the page, banishing the potentially more relevant or user-appealing bits of interest to lower regions of the page. This opposes the purpose of this and other similar social sharing networks: the more is shared, the more interesting it gets. Unfortunately, on Pinterest, it also gets a bit more chaotic.</p> <p>Having many pictures on one page means the user has to scroll down to see more. Aside from the downsides of downloading every single picture on screen and occasionally a freezing browser while scrolling down, the &#8216;scroll to top&#8217; button is a welcome shortcut to the top of the page (although one could just use the &#8216;Home&#8217; button, found on most keyboards).</p> <div id=""attachment_10"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 244px""><img class=""size-full wp-image-10"" alt=""Shortcut button to the top of the page."" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/scrolltotop.png?w=450"" /><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Shortcut button to the top of the page.</p></div> <p>Clicking on one of the pictures displays a larger version of it. While the picture is downloading, a loading animation is being shown, but the user can&#8217;t scroll down to the comments. Due to the position of this animation, if the picture is too large to fit the screen, the user can&#8217;t see that something is happening and can&#8217;t scroll down to see the animation; potentially thinking the application is unresponsive.</p> <p>When finding an interesting picture, it is rather simple to pin or repin, follow or unfollow it. However, pinning a new picture can be a hassle if the user doesn&#8217;t know the URL of that picture. Also, each pinned picture requires a specific board to which it is pinned and a comment, which is the only way of finding a specific picture, thus solely relying on the description given by the pinner when searching for it. In other words, the search function doesn&#8217;t search for displayed objects, but for matching words in the given description, which could be misleading.</p> <p>Writing a comment on a picture works like expected, but instead of providing more regularity and diminishing chaos, only some pictures on the new user&#8217;s main page have a comment field. Although, clicking on any picture allows writing a comment. Many users are also accustomed to pressing enter when done writing to post the comment, however, Pinterest requires the user to click the post button.</p> <p>Like all other social networks, Pinterest requires new users to register. Aside from the fact that it isn&#8217;t possible to register by clicking on &#8216;login&#8217;, in some cases, the user trying to register is greeted with an error, which is displayed in English, irrespective of the language set by the user. Not only is the text describing the error displayed in a very subtle way, it also is too generic and doesn&#8217;t give the user a hint of what went wrong. Did the user do something wrong?

We sat together with another team (<a title=""Team S-CHI"" href=""http://teamschi.wordpress.com"" target=""_blank"">Team S-CHI</a>), to come up with ideas, this because 2-3 people is too small a group for brainstorming.</p> <p>The most important rule for this brainstorming session was: no criticism. Every idea was valuable in this stage, even the most far-fetched ones. Quantity over quality!</p> <p>This was the result of our brainstorm:</p> <p><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-26-02-13-14-55-57.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-34"" alt=""Brainstorm"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-26-02-13-14-55-57.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>Or in more readable form:</p> <p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstormnl.png""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-56 aligncenter"" alt=""Brainstormdiagram (Dutch)"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstormnl.png?w=300&#038;h=114"" width=""300"" height=""114"" /></a></p> <p>We&#8217;ve also included a &#8216;translation&#8217; for those of you who do not speak Dutch:</p> <p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstormen.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-57"" alt=""Brainstorm (English)"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstormen.png?w=300&#038;h=114"" width=""300"" height=""114"" /></a></p> <p>In the beginning of the brainstorm session, our main focus was around recommending in the centre with possibilities such as &#8216;re-recommending&#8217;, questions, etc. Afterwards our focus shifted more towards users and the different possibilities associated with them.<br /> You can also see that we came up with a lot of &#8216;types&#8217; of recommendations. Note also the people subtopic. More on that later when we talk about storyboarding.<br /> The concept of liking and disliking recommendations other people made for you, seemed also very appealing. By counting likes and dislikes of recommendations someone made, a user could gain some credibility, or trustworthiness.</p> <p>Since it isn&#8217;t possible for us to focus on all these things, we had to select some of them. We decided that the ideas we would pursue, were the recommendation of places, and things from which you can make pictures.</p> <h3>Storyboarding</h3> <p>After the brainstorming, we were ready to draw some storyboards. A storyboard is a kind of comic that tells a story of one or more users and how they would use the application. It is important to focus on the story and not the way the user interacts with the application, only what he uses the application for.</p> <p>An easy way to draw users is as &#8216;star people&#8217;, you can see our star people in the images below. Star people are just little people with a star for a body, which is easy to draw. To make a distinction between different star people, we also added some geometries.</p> <p>We made two storyboards:</p> <p><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-26-02-13-18-28-10.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-36"" alt=""Photo 26-02-13 18 28 10"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-26-02-13-18-28-10.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>This storyboard tells the story of the &#8216;triangle user&#8217;. The triangle user sees a nice building and uses the application to recommend the building to the &#8216;square user&#8217;. Then the square user goes to see the building himself, finds he likes it too and decides to like the recommendation the triangle user made.<br /> <a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/storyboard-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-38"" alt=""Storyboard 2"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/storyboard-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>In the second storyboard we told the story of a male user who recommends a girl or a woman to another male user. In this context, recommending a person means, to us anyway, that some user indicates that he/she thinks the other user will like the recommended person and should get to know him/her.</p> <p>The reaction to this storyboard was somewhat divided. It seems like a fun idea, during brainstorming, to recommend people to other people, but it is easy for users to misuse this possibility and for the application to deteriorate to that use only. With current social media as an example, posting photos of other people on the web can lead to very painful situations.</p> <p>After the storyboarding, we decided to keep the idea of recommendations of places and the possibility to like or dislike a recommendation someone made to you.</p> <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3> <p>The last part of the session was dedicated to the creation of a prototype of the application we had in mind. Not a digital prototype, but a paper prototype. This means that we should be able to test the most important functionality of the actual application interface with this prototype.</p> <p>A paper prototype consists of just a couple of screens, shown by the application, drawn on paper. You can test the functionality of the prototype by letting the user push imaginary buttons on the paper screen in front of him and, depending on the button he pushed, putting another paper screen in front of him or putting a post-it, which functions as a pop-up, on top of the current screen.</p> <p>In our paper prototype the user is able to recommend places to other people, get an overview of his own recommendations and view all the recommendations, or &#8216;suggestions&#8217; as we called them, other users made to him.</p> <p>We also chose the name &#8216;What&#8217;s Up&#8217; for the application, but of course this, and also the design, can change after we get some feedback.</p> <p><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/paper-prototype.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-37"" alt=""Paper prototype"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/paper-prototype.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a></p> <p>We designed the following screens:</p> <h4>Login Screen (upper left)</h4> <p>This screen allows the user to login or sign-up.</p> <h4>Suggestions (upper middle)</h4> <p>This is the screen where all the suggestions, that the user received, are displayed. If the user liked or disliked a suggestion, it&#8217;s marked in red or green. Different colour intensities offer the possibility to have a more detailed scale.</p> <h4>Suggestion Detail (upper right)</h4> <p>The suggestion detail screen shows the detailed information of a single suggestion and allows the user to rate it.</p> <h4>My Recommendations (center left)</h4> <p>My recommendations contains the recommendations the user made to others and their rating in colour.</p> <h4>Recommend! (center)</h4> <p>Recommend! allows the user to make new suggestions to other users. The pop-up on its rights shows up when adding photos and allows the user to make a new one or select an existing one from his device.</p> <h4>Explore (under left)</h4> <p>Finally, the explore screen allows the user to search other users, places or subjects.</p> <h3>Next up&#8230;</h3> <p>Next week, we will test this paper prototype to see how usable it really is. Very exciting to see if some test users will think the same way we thought when designing the prototype or if they will have trouble finding their way through our application.</p> <p>We&#8217;d like to hear your thoughts on our preliminary results so please comment!</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:11 PM

First professor Erik Duval explained the general concepts of human-computer interaction and that it was very important to look at software systems from the user-side of things.</p> <p>You can find more information about this course, the other teams and their blogs on <a href=""http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/wiki/index.php/Chi_2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/wiki/index.php/Chi_2013</a> .</p> <p>It was immediately clear that in designing a useful interface, it is important to iterate over the design. You need to design, evaluate and implement (notice the order!), test and look for problems at least a couple of times, so you can filter out problems.</p> <p>To get a first touch with evaluating a user interface, our assignment was to write down all pros and cons of the Pinterest-application (<a href=""http://pinterest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinterest.com</a>).</p> <p>The most pressing problems we identified with the user interface Pinterest provided were the following:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;"">When you don&#8217;t have an account and you&#8217;re browsing the main page, there is always box that gives you the?possibility to login or to register. Even when you scroll down, the box stays on top of your screen, so you can&#8217;t really do a lot when you&#8217;re not registered and logged in, as you can see in the image below. Pinterest quite firmly pushes you into registering.</span><a style=""line-height:13px;"" href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/login.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6"" alt=""Login"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/login.png?w=300&#038;h=198"" width=""300"" height=""198"" /></a></li> <li>Secondly, we thought it was annoying that Pinterest automatically chose some privacy settings when registering. An example is that the setting, which indicates that Google shows your Pinterest-profile in their search results, is automatically turned ON. (Actually, the setting that Google doesn&#8217;t show your profile is turned OFF, but this means the same thing). You can easily turn this feature OFF in the settings of your profile, but if you don&#8217;t think of that, it will obviously remain ON forever. We realize that this isn&#8217;t a point of concern for most users, but it would be nice if Pinterest just asked this while creating your profile.</li> <li>Also, once you&#8217;re logged in, the page you see, your main page, is very unstructured and busy. You don&#8217;t really know where to look first or what to do.</li> <li>At last, the whole concept of &#8216;pinning&#8217; wasn&#8217;t clear to us in the beginning. When you click the &#8216;add&#8217;-button, you will see the screen below. A first-time user won&#8217;t know what to do with this, so it would be nice if there was some extra information.<a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/toevoegen.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7"" alt=""Add"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/toevoegen.png?w=300&#038;h=163"" width=""300"" height=""163"" /></a></li> </ul> <p>On the other hand Pinterest did some things very good:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;"">It was very clear to the user how to login or how to create an account. The process for creating an account was very easy (only if an account couldn&#8217;t be created, the error message didn&#8217;t indicate the problem, just that there was a problem).</span></li> <li>It immediately addressed us in the correct language.</li> <li>The menu bar with categories follows while you scroll down the page.</li> </ul> <p>The second part of the lecture we had to put the interface to the test. We had to think of some tasks other people had to do and observe which problems they encountered when executing these tasks.</p> <p>First we asked them to create a board and &#8216;repin&#8217; someone else&#8217;s picture on that board. Because these people had gained some experience with Pinterest in the mean time, they didn&#8217;t have any problems with this.</p> <p>Next we asked them to find one of our profiles and follow us. Searching for something was easy, the search bar is right on top of the main page. But when you search for something, the search results that are displayed, are &#8216;pins&#8217; not people. To find the search results on people, you had to click on &#8216;pinners&#8217;, which wasn&#8217;t immediately clear to the test users.</p> <p>Finally we asked them to locate the help page. The link to the help page is located in the &#8216;about&#8217; dropdown-menu, so it is only visible when you move your mouse over this menu. When doing this test, we also noticed it was very hard to contact Pinterest, i.e. send them an e-mail. To do this, you first had to choose a topic that was related to your problem and only then a button with &#8216;email help&#8217; was shown.</p> <p>These problems aren&#8217;t really big issues for most of the users, so based on this we can conclude that the user interface provided by Pinterest is very useful and usable.</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:11 PM

For those who don&#8217;t know the concept of brainstorming: you just say everything that comes to mind out loud, regardless of whether you think it&#8217;s a good or bad idea. That way you can get so many ideas floating around, there&#8217;s bound to be some good ones in there. It didn&#8217;t take more than a few minutes, but afterwards we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted: a recommendation system focused on the idea of <em>personal</em> recommendations, as opposed to recommending things to anyone who will listen (the latter is more &#8216;sharing&#8217; than it is &#8216;recommending&#8217;).</p> <p>We had an idea, now we needed to refine it; time to bring in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard#Software"" target=""_blank"">storyboarding</a>. Using a storyboard, you can show how you intend for people to use your product. It doesn&#8217;t need to be pretty (as evidenced by our own storyboard), it just needs to show why and how someone would use your product and what they would get out of it. Storyboarding is pretty fun and doesn&#8217;t take a lot of time (if it <em>does</em> take a lot of time, you&#8217;re probably doing it wrong), and it helps a lot in explaining your ideas. You&#8217;ll notice our storyboard has been edited a bit, the original was partly in Dutch so we translated it.</p> <div id=""attachment_101"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chikulstoryboard.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-101"" alt=""A highly captivating story about Jos and his friend Starman"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chikulstoryboard.jpg?w=300&#038;h=233"" width=""300"" height=""233"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">A highly captivating story about Jos and his friend Starman</p></div> <p>Now it was time for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping"" target=""_blank"">paper prototyping</a>: a quick and dirty first design. Just draw out your interface on paper, cut out menus and windows so you can &#8220;interact&#8221; with it and you have a paper prototype. If some idea doesn&#8217;t work you can just throw it out and draw a better one in minutes. Paper prototyping is a great way to get a first impression of an interface, without having to spend hours of interface-programming, just to find out it doesn&#8217;t feel right. A drawback of the paper prototyping is that because paper doesn&#8217;t have an &#8220;undo&#8221; function, if you forget to put something in you&#8217;ll have to draw it all over (or cut out the parts that work and paste them on a new paper, but that&#8217;s not always an option).</p> <p>We&#8217;ve made our own prototype which we will test next week on a &#8220;user&#8221; that hasn&#8217;t seen the design before. It&#8217;s supposed to represent a laptop/pc/tablet screen. Key points in the design are:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;"">An activity feed column (on the right) showing all recommendations you made/received</span></li> <li>An arrow per recommendation indicating if it was a recommendation you made or one you received</li> <li>The recommendations can be &#8216;unfolded&#8217; to see more details by selecting them</li> <li>A &#8216;user&#8217; column (on the left) containing profile info, a button to make new recommendations and filtering options</li> </ul> <div id=""attachment_97"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 310px""><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/005.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-97"" alt=""The main screen as a paper prototype"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/005.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The main screen</p></div> <div id=""attachment_96"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 235px""><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/003-e1362080047731.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-96"" alt=""An overview of all the parts of our paper prototype"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/003-e1362080047731.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">An overview of all the parts of our paper prototype</p></div> "	2013/03/01 05:25:13 PM

The lecture addressed the general ideas behind human-computer interaction, and an introduction to the evaluation of user interfaces.</p> <p>A summary of some of the concepts we have learned about can be found <a title=""Human-Computer Interaction: evaluation and?design"" href=""http://igchi.wordpress.com/human-computer-interaction/overview/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p> <h2>Evaluation of the <em>Pinterest</em> website</h2> <p>Among the activities and lectures in the class, we were tasked with testing out the social media website <em>Pinterest</em>?to try?and find both good and bad elements of its UI and the user experience when using the application for what it?is intended. Among these factors were not only the buttons and text boxes that are displayed, but also how long it took to figure out how certain functionalities work, as well as what <a title=""pinterest.com"" href=""http://pinterest.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pinterest</a> is used for.</p> <p>We used two methods. The first was a rather naive and straightforward method. The second method was a particular evaluation technique often used for real usability studies, called the think aloud protocol.</p> <h3>A quick evaluation</h3> <p>As a first step, we needed to observe the application ourselves and discuss our findings. The positive points that were gleaned from this short testing session are listed in <strong>Table 1</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Table 1 :</strong> positives and negatives detected on the <em>Pinterest</em> website during a quick evaluation.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Positive</strong></td> <td> <ul> <li>Registration is straightforward. A mere press of a single button that is clearly and centrally displayed is all that is required.</li> <li>The general interface on the front page is simple and takes little time to understand. This is due to the fact that most functionality is a mere one to two clicks away and all buttons/dropdown lists have text describing what they are there for. This makes navigation quick and easy for newcomers and experts.</li> <li>Most UI elements are located at the top, this includes any functionality and the search textbox. Below these are all the pinned images. This once more illustrates easy access.</li> <li>The point of the entire website is quickly understood: a platform for sharing media in the form of images, video and more. Nothing beyond the front page feed is required to understand this, illustrating a good design that can quickly draw in &#8216;accidental&#8217; visitors to the site or people who were only mildly curious. Both of these would quickly close the tab if they didn&#8217;t quickly understand what the site was all about.</li> <li>The About tab is concise and to-the-point, allowing for any questions to be resolved quickly. However, the help topics are perhaps a bit too simple, meaning contacting an admin is required for anything beyond the basic functionality.</li> <li>Creating boards and pinning media is easy to figure out as text and images guide you through the process. However, anything beyond the basics of these functionalities becomes unclear due to the absence of text or labels (contradictory how they do it in one place but then don&#8217;t in another).</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Negative</strong></td> <td> <ul> <li>Errors in registration are reported through vague and unhelpful messages. For example: Registration continued to fail on the laptop we were using and the only help we were offered came in the form of a message that did not specify what went wrong and said to &#8216;try again later&#8217;; what is later? This would quickly result in casual visitors losing interest.</li> <li>Upon registering, we were automatically following several individuals on the site and also had a board that we had not created that seemed to contain random images. As far as we understand, this is merely to show what can be done, but only results in confusion.</li> <li>The button to unfollow an individual is grayed out and looks like a typical &#8216;disabled&#8217; button, making a user think they can&#8217;t actually click it.</li> <li>The site isn&#8217;t fully compatible with all drivers. For example, when looking at an image, the image is zoomed in and a semi-opaque white color is drawn across the background to &#8216;fade it out&#8217; and focus the attention on the image and other UI elements. However, this opaque background does not function as intended in Chrome, in which it is a solid white background. This created confusion in how to return to the front page feed, which is normally done by clicking the opaque background. Instead of an overlay, it looked like a different page.</li> <li>&#8216;Gifts&#8217; are poorly explained and seem, at first sight, like a rather random thing to add to the site&#8217;s lineup of functionality. Perhaps a different name or some kind of basic information needs to be added for it to become more accessible.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Afterwards, each group had to give the issue they were most concerned about. Interestingly, these issues diverged. Even when considering the top three issues discovered by each group, there was remarkably little overlap.</p> <p>Our main concern was the lack of information given by the system when an error occurred while making a new account. Professor Duval also pointed out that the language of the error message (English) did not match the language of the website (Dutch in our case).</p> <h3>Evaluation with the think aloud technique</h3> <p>After this session, we were tasked to use what we learned about evaluating a user interface and give small, atomic assignments to another team. These assignments would revolve around using Pinterest and, while the testers performed these tasks, we would have to observe their actions and listen to their feedback or &#8216;out-loud thoughts&#8217;.</p> <p>We gave our testers the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>Create a board;</li> <li>Pin an image from a googled url to this board;</li> <li>Look up media of a specific interest that someone else posted;</li> <li>Follow that user.</li> </ul> <p>We observed the following points:</p> <ul> <li>Adding a board was done quickly and effortlessly, in no small part due to the presence of the Add+ button in the upper right corner.</li> <li>When creating a board, inviting someone can be a bit confusing as one needs to enter the name, but pressing the enter key does not add this person to the list of invitees, one has to press the appropriate button of the UI instead.</li> <li>When the board is empty, it can be a bit confusing to use as the screen has very few indications present that the user is actually *in* the board.</li> <li>There is little to no indication when adding a pin what information needs to be filled in where. Also, it is unclear that, when a user pastes in an url that they can cycle through all the images Pinterest finds on this page. The &#8216;prev&#8217; and &#8216;next&#8217; buttons are simply too ambiguous, especially if you enter an URL that goes directly to a single image, since there will be nothing to cycle through.</li> <li>Commenting, repinning and searching is as easy as creating a board.</li> <li>Browsing through results is identical to browsing through the front page feed, which makes it all the easier to learn how to use.</li> </ul> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>In short, Pinterest has its share of problems, but they are mostly minor and the application is generally straigthforward and easy to use. It would benefit from a few more labels and other textual indications to go with UI fields that can/must be filled out when performing certain tasks (such as pinning). The creators of the application did make a few odd decisions. Much of their UI is straightforward to use and clearly marked, so why are other parts so ambiguous and why did they stop this modus operandi there?</p> <p>Regardless, the application does what it needs to and is easy to see why it is popular since the UI is simple and one doesn&#8217;t have to be an expert with a computer (or even just a browser) to know how to navigate most of its day-to-day functionality.</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:14 PM

So before talking about the application we&#8217;ll be using in the chikul course, let us show you the storyboard we came up with.</p> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard.png""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-18"" alt=""Storyboard"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard.png?w=449&#038;h=336"" width=""449"" height=""336"" /></a></p> <p>The basic concept of the application is to share your experiences when visiting the local &#8220;Frituur&#8221;, a &#8220;Frituur&#8221; is a typical Belgian phenomenon. It&#8217;s a take-away for french fries topped with insane amounts and various snacks of questionable origin. We don&#8217;t expect foreigners to understand why we like this <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p> <p>There are two distinct flows in the storyboard. On the upper side, there&#8217;s mister V who just visited Frituur Pat. He liked the overall experience and wants to recommend this place to the world. He opens the application on his mobile device and indicates he likes Frituur Pat. Additionally, he wants to let his friends know he just recommended this specific Frituur. &#8220;Sharing with friends&#8221; in this context can be seen as a recommendation itself. Below is the other flow. One day, mister O is feeling hungry. Like all Belgians he&#8217;s craving for more fries. Luckily, the application can tell him which Frituur is recommended by others, or specifically by his friends.</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:15 PM

Taking the practical approach, we&#8217;ll try to do this by making an application and evaluating it, paying specific attention to its usability. In the second session of this course, we were introduced to the topic of this years assignment:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;Someone recommending? something to someone else&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Keeping this concept in mind, the next thing was to come up with an idea for a specific application. We did this with a brainstorm session.</p> <p>When brainstorming, you should try to follow these 4 guidelines :</p> <ul> <li><strong>Quantity over Quality:?</strong>? It is important to have many ideas. If you think of something just spit it out!</li> <li><strong>Absolutely no criticism:</strong> Try not to judge suggestions a team mate made, there are no ideas that are a priori bad. Ideas that turn out to not be usable can be filtered afterwards.</li> <li><strong>Weird idea&#8217;s are welcome: </strong>Mention the ideas that happen to linger in your mind. They may seem weird at the beginning, but something good can evolve from them. Also if you don&#8217;t speak out a weird idea that you are playing with, it will be a blocking factor to find other ideas.</li> <li><strong>Transparent ideas: </strong>Try build new ideas based on the ideas that are already given. Adapt ideas or combine a few to create a new one.</li> </ul> <p>For our brainstorming session we teamed up with <a title=""Team tgv"" href=""https://teamtgv.wordpress.com/"">teamtgv</a>!</p> <p>The session was very productive. We came up with a lot of ideas that all seemed very useful. You can see flow of ideas in the picture below!

Our assignment was to evaluate the usability of <a title=""Pinterest Homepage"" href=""http://www.pinterest.com"" target=""_blank"">Pinterest</a>&#8216;s interface by letting other students perform -seemingly- simple tasks. For each task, we took informal notes on the effectiveness (was the task completed?), efficiency (how well did the task go?) and satisfaction (did the user enjoy the task?) of performing the tasks. Each student had to be both evaluator and evaluatee at least once. Rather than separating theory from practice, this little experiment gave us an immediate raw experience of how usability is a complex issue with many facets. Next we will discuss some of the tasks performed and our results. Some tasks were very similar to those executed by other groups as well. It will be interesting to compare the results!</p> <p><strong>Task 1</strong>: Pin any topic containing a picture of Lego bricks on one of your boards.</p> <ul> <li>Effectiveness: The task was completely performed.</li> <li>Efficiency: The user needed only 5 mouseclicks to perform the task. There were no repeated or unnecessary actions done by the user.</li> <li>Satisfaction: The user seemed to browse pinterest&#8217;s with a breeze though he stated not to be familiar with the interface at all.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Task 2</strong>: Send an e-mail to Pinterest&#8217;s customer support.</p> <ul> <li>Effectiveness: The task was completely performed.</li> <li>Efficiency: The user needed a substantial amount of mouseclicks and time to perform the task. He also needed to read certain parts of the site to know how to locate the correct sections. Some actions had to be repeated to complete the task.</li> <li>Satisfaction: There were moments the user was confused about what to do next. It&#8217;s unclear whether Pinterest tried too hard to be helpful (the help center is huge!) or if they didn&#8217;t try enough (please don&#8217;t bother us with your e-mails).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Task 3</strong>: Pin any topic of user XYZ on one of your boards.</p> <ul> <li>Effectiveness: The task was completely performed.</li> <li>Efficiency: There were no repeated or unnecessary actions done by the user.</li> <li>Satisfaction: The user already knew what the tricky part of this task was (namely, when searching for something, you have to search for &#8216;pinners&#8217; and not for &#8216;boards&#8217;) but he seemed to remember it well.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Task 4</strong>: Make it so a certain pin on the Pinterest homepage will no longer appear for you.</p> <ul> <li>Effectiveness: The task was completely performed.</li> <li>Efficiency: The user tried some unneceassary actions before the task was completed.</li> <li>Satisfaction: The way Pins are laid out on the homepage seems to suggest a customazible tile interface with simple delete, move or edit functionality but this is not the case. You have to open the pin and unfollow the original author of that pin. This results in the removal of ALL pins from that author. This is not always desirable.</li> </ul> <p>Our little test yielded ambigious results. The effectivity was 100%, but the user was challenged sometimes to achieve this score as indicated by a mediocre efficiency and satisfaction (disregarding the bias on task 3). Of course this shallow evaluation is by no means an in-depth review of Pinterest&#8217;s good, bad and ugly. Nonetheless we already experienced two fundamental concepts about interface design mentioned during the class:</p> <ul> <li>You can&#8217;t achieve 100% usability: it&#8217;s a trade-off between many factors (in this case we commared effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction)</li> <li>You don&#8217;t need a large crowd to discover a large amount of issues with an interface (or, to discover what isn&#8217;t issue).</li> </ul> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pinterest.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-10 aligncenter"" alt=""pinterest"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pinterest.jpg?w=408&#038;h=228"" width=""408"" height=""228"" /></a></p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:15 PM

However, a good user interface generally satisfies three domains: efficiency, effectiveness and (user) satisfaction. Some users will value one of these domains more than the others, while others have different thoughts on the subject.</p> <p>Anyway, the main assignment in the first lesson was having a closer look at <a title=""Pinterest"" href=""http://pinterest.com"">Pinterest</a>, a website which lets people &#8216;pin&#8217; and share all kinds of stuff they find interesting on the internet.</p> <p>More specifically, following tasks were to be performed:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:14px;"">Work a bit with Pinterest. Do you get what it is all about? Can you do the stuff you want to do? Is the user interface clear or confusing at times? &#8230;</span></li> <li>Review what the different teams came up with in the first step.</li> <li>Perform a &#8216;real&#8217; user experience test, where the people acting as?guinea-pigs had to do Pinterest tasks dictated by the team.</li> </ul> <p>In the initial goofing around with Pinterest, one of the first things the team noticed was that error messages on Pinterest are rather cryptic. Things like &#8216;An error has?occurred,?please try again later&#8217; or error messages presented in Portuguese aren&#8217;t very?helpful?to the user.</p> <p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-79"" alt=""portugues"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/portugees.png?w=300&#038;h=165"" width=""300"" height=""165"" /></p> <p>Another thing that bothered us were the popups at account creation?issuing?the new user to?immediately?follow 5 topics of interest. There didn&#8217;t seem to be a way to close these things, and as a new user, it wasn&#8217;t really clear what the consequences of following these topics would be.</p> <p><a href=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pinterestfirstlogin.png""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-81 aligncenter"" alt=""PinterestFirstLogin"" src=""http://jetschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pinterestfirstlogin.png?w=300&#038;h=293"" width=""300"" height=""293"" /></a></p> <p>Once the set up phase was finished however, the interface was rather intuitive (to us) to use.</p> <p>When comparing the issues the different teams had come up with, one thing to note was the lack of?similarities?between them. A nice illustration of the different needs of different users it seems <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>Performing the user experience tests revealed a better insight in how users interact with Pinterest. The testers had to think aloud while performing the actions we told them to do. Finding and following another user was something all testers had problems with. The only solution seemed to use the personal pinterest-url of the wanted user to get to their profile page, from where it was possible to follow them.?Definitely?something Pinterest might want to look into.</p> <p>If one thing became clear from the first lesson, it was that?criticizing a user interface is easy enough, but really pinning down the problems and coming up with a solution to them certainly is not.</p> <p>Hopefully, follow-up lessons will provide more insight into this!</p> <p>&#8211; The JeTS-CHI Team &#8211;</p> "	2013/03/01 05:25:13 PM

The developing consisted of three phases: brainstorming, storyboarding and paper prototyping. During the last session we discovered what the interpretation of these phases were.? The new application had to have one theme:</p> <h5 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Someone</strong> recommends <strong>something</strong> to <strong>someone else</strong><strong><br /> </strong></h5> <h4><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Brainstorming</span></h4> <p>In collaboration with <a title=""Team LPG"" href=""http://lpg13.wordpress.com/"">team LPG</a> we started the brainstorming for the new app. A first obstacle to conquer was the urgent need of <a title=""Team LPG"" href=""http://lpg13.wordpress.com/"">team LPG</a> to brainstorm on a laptop while having an ideal green board nearby. We won <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> . Apart from that small issue, a lot of ideas came out. Each member of the two groups provided enough input and this was the result. <a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screenshot-from-2013-02-27-120528.png""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-33 aligncenter"" alt=""Screenshot from 2013-02-27 12:05:28"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screenshot-from-2013-02-27-120528.png?w=545&#038;h=229"" width=""545"" height=""229"" /></a></p> <p>As you can see, there were three major parts on the green board. We thought about <strong>who</strong> could use the app, <strong>what</strong> types the users could recommend and <strong>how</strong> the recommendation would work.</p> <h4><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Storyboarding</span></h4> <p>The next phase of the process was storyboarding. Here we needed to sketch one of the main real-life scenario&#8217;s where our application could be used. Due to a time limit we sketched the first thing that came into our minds.We sketched a person on a party recommending that party to a lazy friend using a picture of a beautiful girl. Here you can see the storyboard.</p> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sb11.png""><img class=""size-large wp-image-57 aligncenter"" alt=""SB1"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sb11.png?w=630&#038;h=173"" width=""630"" height=""173"" /></a></p> <p>It turned out that the idea of the storyboard should have been also the final idea for the application. Because of three main reasons we decided not to go further on this kind of application. First, the application was actually just a replacement for an SMS/MMS. Second, there would be a lot of privacy issues with taking pictures of (un)known people. Third and the most important, we didn&#8217;t actually like this kind of application ourselves en weren&#8217;t fully enthusiastic. Back to the drawing board!</p> <p>The second iteration we started by brainstorming about the actual purpose of the application and for what <strong>we</strong> would use this kind of app. We came to the conclusion that in our environment recommendations were mostly about URL&#8217;s. We liked the idea of speeding up recommending URL&#8217;s and this became the base of the next storyboard.</p> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sb2.jpg""><img class=""wp-image-55 aligncenter"" alt=""SB2"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sb2.jpg?w=504&#038;h=151"" width=""504"" height=""151"" /></a></p> <p>This time our storyboard pictured a guy surfing. At a one moment he is watching some funny stuff online and immediately he thinks of his friend Carl. He thinks Carl would really like this site. So he &#8216;Suggests&#8217; it to his friend. A bit later Carl has taken a look at the site and he informs his friend that he liked it. While storyboarding we found also the perfect name four our brand new application: <strong>Tip-It!?</strong></p> <h4><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Paper Prototyping</span></h4> <p>The next phase of the process was paper prototyping. In this phase we created some prototypes of the interfaces out of paper. With these we can then test the normal flow of the application quickly without having to do any implementation. Our drawing skills were tested to the maximum.</p> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag0191.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-68 aligncenter"" alt=""IMAG0191"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag0191.jpg?w=300&#038;h=179"" width=""300"" height=""179"" /></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With curiosity we look forward to test our prototype to real users!</p> "	2013/03/01 08:07:37 PM

So after a 10 minutes of brainstorming in our group we came up with the following mind map:</p> <p><a href=""http://chimovez.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstorm.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-95"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chimovez.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/brainstorm.jpg?w=710"" /></a></p> <p>On the left you can see the different categories that we came up with for recommending. We thought about Media, people, clothing and others check the mind map for the others <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>There was one location subcategory, however this is shareable in different ways gps coordinates, pictures or even URL&#8217;s of vacation destinations.</p> <p>To the right we brainstormed about different ways of integrating services to recommend these categories. There are different ways of recommending to people. People can be grouped i.e. google circles. Recommending can be public so that everyone can see, or it can be private, one on one recommending. Recommendations can be rated or even rejected.</p> <p>I think we were very surprised about the ideas that came up by just sitting together for 10 minutes. Together with the fact that all groups shared their ideas a lot of creativity was in the classroom. The strategy to just say everything what&#8217;s on your mind, even the stupid things to get them out of your head was fun and entertaining. Bringing some fun to the table doesn&#8217;t mean people can&#8217;t be productive, it even inspires people to be creative.</p> "	2013/03/01 09:08:18 PM

From this point of view, we came up with two interesting story lines which we transformed into two different storyboards:</p> <p><img src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/11102l1.jpg"" width=""1600"" height=""1200"" class=""alignnone"" /></p> <p>In our first storyboard, our star person starts to feel hungry so he decides to ask for recommendations on what to eat. After entering some details in the application like what or where, he receives a notification that recommendations are available. The shoarma recommendation caught his eye and he immediately went to the shoarma shop. After finishing his meal, he wasn&#8217;t entirely convinced of the quality of the food so he decided not to recommend or discourage the recommendation.</p> <p>Our second storyboard features a person enjoying some good Belgian fries. All of a sudden, he remembers that his friend Stefaan is also a fan of Belgian fries so he sends him a recommendation right away. Stefaan immediately receives a notification, notices it is lunchtime and decides to go and try it out. He is very pleased with the fries and approves the recommendation by giving it a thumbs up.</p> <p>The next step will be to transform these stories into a paper prototype, but this is some material for a whole new post.</p> "	2013/03/01 09:23:22 PM

What we liked very much was the nice mix between theory and practice. The session was divided into 3 main parts so that it not felt like one big session of 5.5 hours. It was also?even more fun because we started to work on our project.?So let&#8217;s get you first up to date with that.</p> <p>(My colleagues can skip this project part)</p> <p><strong>The Project<br /> </strong>&#8220;Build a platform to give recommendations to each other&#8221; =&gt; simple as that! Recommendations can be movies, songs, articles, products, almost every thing and it just should be possible to recommend this to someone, like when you share something at someone&#8217;s Facebook wall. More requirements were not necessary because a brainstorm session was coming up.</p> <p><strong>The Brainstorm<br /> </strong>Everybody knows what a brainstorm is. But I guess most of the people know what a brainstorm should do but not really how you do it. So it was interesting to see some basic brainstorm rules:</p> <ul> <li>Go quantity, not quality</li> <li>Absolutely no criticism</li> <li>Weird ideas are welcome</li> <li>Transform others&#8217; ideas</li> <li>Got a stupid idea? Say it out loud. Just to get rid of it.</li> </ul> <p>After this short lesson/explanation we teamed up to start the brainstorming. We realized it is harder than it looks, especially the weird idea&#8217;s don&#8217;t come out that easy. You still have this little voice in you head that says: &#8216;Don&#8217;t say that, it sucks, think of something better&#8217;. But actually you need a voice that says:?&#8217;Say that, it&#8217; sucks, but it will make someone else think of something better&#8217;. Luckily the brainstorm spirit started after some minutes and we managed to get some good ideas. I will now present two result pictures of our brainstorm session and after the pictures I give you the most valuable ideas. The text is sometimes in Dutch, we apologize for this.</p> <p><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/brainstorm-maaike1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-83"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/brainstorm-maaike1.jpg?w=710"" /></a></p> <p><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-84"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/brainstorm-pj1.jpg?w=604"" /></p> <p>So just to give you a better idea I will highlight 4 ideas (not ordered) that we think were very valuable, I did not include trivial ones likes comments,friends et cetera.</p> <ol> <li>Fast Input-Output: The application can have a lot of features, but giving and receiving recommendations is the core. So it should be possible to do these actions without any the least possible effort (Bookmarklets, push messages,..)</li> <li>Gamification: There should be a motivation to make good recommendations, so every user could get a level of trust based on ratings that receivers can give.</li> <li>Global stats: It would be cool if we could also explore recommendation from out the world, so for example which YouTube movies are recommended most.</li> <li>Ask for recommendations: This was an idea of another group, a person should be able to ask for recommendations and then maybe again reward the best recommender.</li> </ol> <p><strong>The StoryBoard<br /> </strong>The main goal of the storyboard is communicating ideas and it accomplishes this with simple illustrations.?Remark that it is more a way to advertise your product than to really design it.?With a storyboard you tell future users what they can do with your product. A good storyboard defines the context, the sequence of actions and the satisfaction that a user can get of it.</p> <p>Actually it reminded us of the movies that are used by Dropbox and Google:<br /> <em><a href=""https://scast.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/dropbox_intro.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scast.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/dropbox_intro.mp4</a></em><br /> <em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnsfuHX5WU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnsfuHX5WU</a></em><br /> <em><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw</a></em><br /> Although this movies are more animated than our storyboards, they also describe the purpose of a product in a short, simple animated story. So take a look at our storyboards. The text is in Dutch, but an English explanation can be found underneath each story board.</p> <p><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard11.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-134"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard11.jpg?w=604"" /></a></p> <p>For the English reader:<br /> A person is at work at noon and he wonders what to do this evening. He checks his app for recommendations but he does not find anything interesting. He decided that he wants to enjoy a nice movie so he pops the question. At home in the evening he checks his smartphone again and finds several movies. The last picture is lost but normally you see that he his very happy with his movie!</p> <p><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard21.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-135"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/storyboard21.jpg?w=604"" /></a></p> <p>For the English reader:</p> <p>The bald person goes to a restaurant. He takes a picture of the pizza he really like and recommends this to the hairy person. This goes so fast that he can do this while eating his pizza.<br /> The next day the hairy person goes to the same restaurant and he decides to try the pizza. He really likes this indeed so he grabs his smartphone and rates the recommendation as a very good one. He also comments that the bald person was totally right: the pizza is great!</p> <p>A small remark is that Wikipedia seems to disagree with our opinion:?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard#Software. Their definition of storyboards in general definitely matches our interpretation but when they speak of software they seem to focus only on the GUI, while this is not the case in our interpretation. I am (not yet?) an expert myself but maybe we should change this?</p> <p><strong>The Prototype</strong></p> <p>After we had concrete ideas from what the application could do, we started developing the real GUI. You could create prototypes on your PC as well but this is less easy to discuss in group and it takes more time to draw a lot of ideas on your PC than it does on paper. There were some very helpful hints regarding prototypes that we would like to share again.</p> <ul> <li>Have everything you need close by: paper, scissors, pens, pencils, glue, tape, post-its et cetera</li> <li>If you have redundant elements in your GUI, draw them once and copy them to save time</li> <li>Not every element has to be a replica of the screen. Small elements can just be placed on top of another paper.</li> <li>Take the cover of your smartphone (or make one) and place it on your paper to make it more realistic.</li> </ul> <p>Our goal here was to have a complete prototype that went over the basic functionality. We went for smartphone development because we think that this is the main platform for a recommendation application. Recommendations are made in a restaurant or on the road so it is not a good idea to make a desktop application. A mobile application on a website was also an option but with an app you have more options like slide gestures for example. Because available screen space is the biggest issue for smartphones, we believe that we should avoid buttons as much as possible to work with finger gestures instead.</p> <p><em>Sidenote:</em></p> <ol> <li><em>Maybe even finger gestures on desktops in the future? <a href=""http://t.co/7MqEFVURvH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://t.co/7MqEFVURvH</a></em></li> <li><em>Maybe even bend gestures on smartphones/tablets in the future??https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81iiGWdsJgg</em></li> </ol> <p>We looked at some apps that we liked and then started prototyping. The result is in the following picture. You will notice still several buttons but we were afraid that too much special gestures would make it hard for a user to follow. This will definitely be tested during the next session!</p> <p><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prototype.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-155"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prototype.jpg?w=710"" /></a></p> <p>So every paper represent a smartphone screen and a description. Above the horizontal line is smartphone and beneath is description (which is sometimes empty). A small overview of what is what, but it is still a work in progress so there will be a lot of remarks to make!</p> <p>We start off with a simple login/sign up-screen.<br /> Once logged in successfully there will always be a general head bar with 3 options: home, search, settings.<br /> Now you can select one of three options: Explore, For me, For you.<br /> Explore:</p> <ul> <li>Global: see the global trends (anonymous) of recommendations around the world</li> <li>Connections: see the recommendations of friends or from the recommendations to the world of people which you follow.</li> </ul> <p>For?me: This gives you all recommendations that you received.</p> <ul> <li>Recs: All recommendations that you received</li> <li>To Do: Recommendations that your received and decided to try later</li> <li>Favo&#8217;s: Recommendations that you really enjoyed and therefore keep for later use.</li> </ul> <p>For you (not yet): What are the things I suggested, and to who? How did they rate my recommendations?<br /> You can also see that a recommendation is tagged, when you click on such tag, you can browse worldwide recommendations based on tags. These screens slide over your main screen.</p> <p>If you are interested how this will be improved, then come back next week and have a look!<em id=""__mceDel""><em id=""__mceDel""><em id=""__mceDel""><em id=""__mceDel""><em id=""__mceDel""><br /> </em></em></em></em></em></p> <p>Best regards<br /> CHInterest</p> "	2013/03/01 10:39:06 PM

The assignment actually consists of only a few simple words: &#8220;make something to recommend something to someone&#8221;. However, the priority is not actually to make something but rather to design a user-friendly interface because every great applications starts with a clean and simple interface. </p> <p>The first step in a good design is an active brainstorming session. For this task, we paired up with <a href=""http://chiconcarne.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chi Con Carne</a> and produced the following mindmap:</p> <p><img src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17052396/2013-02-26%2014.55.32.jpg"" width=""2592"" height=""1944"" class=""alignnone"" /></p> <p>This mindmap clearly shows that any idea can be used and nothing or no one should be excluded from the brainstorming process. No idea should be criticised because even the weirdest idea can lead to an interesting contribution.</p> <p>After reviewing the mindmap, we highlighted the items that we think are the most relevant features of the application. These items include recommending and discouraging something to someone, the actual type of items that can be recommended and the possibility to ask for a recommendation. All of these things will be included in our storyboard which will be unveiled in our next post!</p> "	2013/03/01 08:52:57 PM

The?<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol"">think aloud method</a>?has proven quite useful to figure out what caused some of our problems.</p> <p>Here are the problems we discovered with these tests:</p> <ol> <li>Unclear like/dislike buttons for a recommendation</li> <li>No possibility to comment on a recommendation</li> <li>Sliders in the &#8220;advanced filters&#8221; menu are not?recognized?as sliders.</li> <li>Meaning of the &#8220;time&#8221; filter in the advanced filters is ambiguous</li> <li>Unclear which fields are required when creating a recommendation</li> <li>Missing reset filter button (we noticed this ourselves afterwards, it wasn&#8217;t needed in the test scenarios)</li> </ol> <p>The modifications we made to the prototype to solve these problems were:</p> <ol> <li>We changed the like/dislike button-icons to thumbs up/down and moved them to a more visible place.</li> <li>Comments are still not implemented. We think the problem was caused with the way the question was worded in combination with problem (1) (We formulated the question as: &#8220;How would you let the recommender know that you liked his recommendation?&#8221;)</li> <li>We&#8217;ve redrawn the sliders in the advanced filters menu to make them more look like actual sliders. Hopefully, this will solve the problem future tests. Otherwise we&#8217;ll have to keep this in mind to test on a digital prototype with actual sliders to see if a different solution is required.</li> <li>A second &#8220;time&#8221; filter was added to enable to filter both on the time posted and the given time of the event (if included in the recommendation).</li> <li>We added a small red star to the required fields of a recommendation. Since this is often used in a lot of popular applications this should make clear which fields are required.</li> <li>A filter-reset button was added.</li> </ol> <p>Some further explanation on why comments are not implemented might be required: We think that the main use of the application is to just share interesting things, like a movie you found on youtube, a picture of your cat, an idea for a birthday present etc. It should then suffice to just like or dislike the recommendation so the other person can figure out?whether?he can keep sending you similar posts or if he has?misjudged?your points of interest completely.</p> <p>Do you agree with this idea or do you think we should clutter our recommendation overview with response post as well? (This is totally not a biased question)</p> <p>To finish this blog post we&#8217;ll give a sneak preview relating to our next set of user tests. An?anonymous?user indicated that the thumb up reminds him of the like on?Facebook?and that it might be a good idea to show a message on his?Facebook?wall like: &#8220;John has liked a recommendation made by Thomas about a cute cat using ?&lt;name of our application&gt;&#8221;. This to attract interested users to the application.</p> <p>What do you guys think about this, is it a good idea to put up a message on your wall like this? Or does it feel like spamming too much?</p> "	2013/03/06 08:52:01 PM

First of all we rearranged the layout of the &#8216;recommend&#8217;-screen, which we also renamed to &#8216;recommend location&#8217;. We put the &#8216;location&#8217;-field almost at the top of the screen, so the user would definitely notice this. In combination with the name of the tab, &#8216;recommend location&#8217;, it should be more clear that the user should recommend a location and that other information is optional.</p> <p>We also changed the working of the search-function. After searching, all results are shown now and the toggle buttons can be used as filters, to filter out unwanted results.</p> <p>After these changes we tested the prototype again on some different test users. The only problems that came up then were related to the fact that it is a?<em>paper</em> prototype and not a digital one. For example, it wasn&#8217;t clear that the toggle buttons on the search tab were toggle buttons, which would have been clear on a computer screen.</p> <p>At last we also noticed that our paper prototype used screens that were bigger than mobile screens. So we drew all screens again, but on a smaller scale and tested the prototype again. The conclusion drawn from these tests, was that the reduced screen-size wasn&#8217;t a big issue.</p> <p>The last part of the session we started on digitizing the prototype.</p> "	2013/03/06 10:23:05 PM

Since we are sharing locations and we designed our prototype that way, it will be a mobile application. ?This has an important consequence we must take into consideration:</p> <p>There is a huge fragmentation of mobile platforms, although there are 2 dominant players: iOS and Android (but Android has many different versions!)</p> <p>This means if we want to be able to run the app on different platforms, weu2019ll have to write it multiple times. Since thereu2019s no mobile platform middleware as far as we know.</p> <h3>Mobile web applications</h3> <p>The only thing that comes remotely close to having to write the application only once, is writing a mobile web app. In this case our application is some kind of mobile website. By using the new features of HTML5 (e.g. local offline cache, etc.), CSS3 and JavaScript, such an application can approach the behaviour of a local application. Because the application is a web site, you can also run and test it on any pc, which can also be useful.</p> <p>But of course, not all the mobile browsers implement all the features, so there still might be some minor platform differences to be taken into account.</p> <h3>Tiggzi</h3> <p>To find a solution, we have searched the web a lot and we found the following website: <a href=""http://www.tiggzi.com"">http://www.tiggzi.com</a>. Tiggzi allows you to easily build your mobile application from scratch by dragging the different components to the screen.</p> <p>Iu2019ve included a preview of a quick draft of our application:</p> <p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggzistartscreen.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-72"" alt=""StartScreen in Tigzi"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggzistartscreen.png?w=300&#038;h=219"" width=""300"" height=""219"" /></a><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggzinew.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71"" alt=""New Recommendation in Tiggzi"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggzinew.png?w=300&#038;h=218"" width=""300"" height=""218"" /></a></p> <p>Afterwards, Tiggzi allows you to export the HTML code of your mobile web app, even the platform specific HTML-code as displayed in the following screen shot.</p> <p><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggziexport.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-70"" alt=""Export in Tiggzi"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tiggziexport.png?w=300&#038;h=195"" width=""300"" height=""195"" /></a></p> <p>There is unfortunately also a big downside. The free account on Tiggzi only allows applications with up to three pages, which is too small for us. And the cheapest paying subscription is quite expensive (priced at $40 a month). Weu2019ll try to overcome this somewhat, as you can export your code and continue working on it yourself.</p> <p>Weu2019ll keep you posted, in case we find any other (hopefully free) solutions.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Whether we choose for mobile apps or mobile web apps, there are some trade-offs to be made. Mobile apps definitely have an advantage in speed and features. But mobile web apps can also be used offline and are mostly cross-platform, which is quite an advantage. Also the feature set of new web technologies is ever-increasing.</p> <p>Do you think a mobile web application is a viable alternative? Or should we commit to a single platform?</p> "	2013/03/08 03:35:56 PM

In the next iteration of the paper prototype, we&#8217;ve addressed this issue. To keep the interface cleaner, we decided to collapse the details of each kind of filter into blocks containing just the title of the filter. When a block is selected it will open, revealing the additional settings. Besides this, we also simplified the filters themselves (being able to specify time frames in minute precision is a bit overkill, filtering by day probably suffices). This results in a easier-to-understand filter system.</p> <p>A second thing we picked up on from last session, as well as from some blog comments, was that it is a good idea to focus on core functionality first. Later, when the application becomes popular and frequently used, there will be plenty of opportunity to add additional features. This is why we decided not to allow comments for now and to throw out the &#8216;group&#8217; concept.</p> <p>Initially, the groups were meant as a communities that could be joined. It would also be possible to send recommendations to whole groups. However, how this joining of groups would work and?who would be able to create these groups still remained unclear. Giving it some thought, it turned out to be too complex.

We did this by asking our fellow students to execute certain tasks on our paper prototype and by asking their feedback after the test. But before we did these tests we actually tried the tests ourself so that the test result could not be biased because of a badly executed test. Did anybody else?actually?do this? When I was the test subject I actually had a feeling in some other groups that there were some disagreements on how certain interactions with the paper prototype had to be done.</p> <p>Anyway, here is a listing of what we asked of the user:</p> <ul> <li>Recommend a new location to Sally.</li> <li>Look at a new incoming interaction.</li> <li>Reply to a new interaction.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Iteration 1</strong></p> <p>After our first test round which consisted of 4 tests we found the following issues:</p> <p>Problem 1: Meaning of the arrows on the interaction history is not clear. Some actually thought they were a shortcut button straight to the interaction&#8217;s conversation and others did not link it to the incoming and outgoing interaction concept.</p> <p>Solution1: We made the arrows green and red as people often relate red and green with incoming and outgoing (often indication for calls). We also played with the idea of just using text. Instead of arrows we could use &#8216;from&#8217; and &#8216;to&#8217;. Green and red are actually not?separable?by some people with color blindness.</p> <p>Problem 2: This relates to the previous. The filter buttons (arrows) on top of the list was not clear. This could actually be a problem inherent to the paper prototype. Users had trouble seeing them as toggle buttons. But of course toggle buttons are hard to show on a paper prototype as there is not enough feedback available.</p> <p>Solution 2: As we think this problem arised because of the paper prototype, we did not change it.</p> <p>Problem 3: ?Login in was not clear for the user without an account. He was not clear how the login would work without a register button.</p> <p>Solution 3: We are going to make use of Facebook to login and so there will be shown a &#8216;Facebook connect&#8217; button instead of a custom login form.</p> <p>Problem 4 : Some feedback we received from one of the test users was that the &#8216;received&#8217; or &#8216;sent&#8217; keyword on the interaction detail view was not really integrated in the view itself.</p> <p>Solution 4: He actually suggested to remove it and replace it by adding &#8216;from&#8217; and &#8216;to&#8217; before the interaction names. This created more of a coherent feeling between the interaction overview and the interaction detail view because they both would use the &#8216;from&#8217; and &#8216;to&#8217; keyword.</p> <p>Problem 5: The test user was surprised that new interaction events did not appear at the top of the interaction list.</p> <p>Solution 5: Sort the interaction list according to latest interaction event date.</p> <p>Problem 6: The &#8216;sent arrow&#8217; was not clear in an interaction conversation. People did not see it was actually the button to send it.</p> <p>Solution 6: We tried to improve the drawing of the arrow.</p> <p>Problem 7: The magnifying glass to select a contact for sending a new location was not clear. This was because we created a text input field next to the magnifying glass and people tried to click that input field. 2 out of 4 people had this problem.</p> <p>Solution 7: We removed the input field and made one big button. If the contact is chosen the name appears in the button with the magnifying glass as a logo. The contact can be changed by clicking again on that button.</p> <p>Problem 8: A taken picture cannot be canceled or changed after the user accepted it.</p> <p>Solution 8: We changed the picture button with 2 buttons; one to remove it and the other to take a new picture.</p> <p><strong>Iteration 2</strong></p> <p>We changed our prototype to these new conclusions and started evaluating the paper prototype a second time.</p> <p>This time the second goal in our user test was adjusted by asking to filter the evaluation prototype while searching for the new interaction.</p> <p>This time there were no real problems. But we got some extra feedback which we are going to incorporate?into our digital prototype.</p> <p>We are going to include an optional share on facebook wall or twitter feed,?add google maps ( or another maps service) to show where a location is and add the?conversation in the detail view. This is something we cannot test on a digital prototype as we need to be able to see how much will fit on a screen. This is why we created a?separate?view for the conversations in our previous iterations.</p> 	2013/03/10 10:56:12 PM

There were some remarks that occurred at least two times with different users :</p> <ul> <li><span style=""line-height:13px;"">The logo on our main page was way too big, looked like a button and distracted the users from the actual functionality.</span></li> <li>The Tip-it plug-in logo on the browser was too big. This space is very valuable!</li> <li>The preview of a Tip wasn&#8217;t very clear to the user. Was it the site? Was it a picture?<br /> <a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag00291.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" alt=""IMAG0029"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag00291.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a></li> <li>There was no management for the concept &#8216;friends&#8217;. Who are the persons you can Tip to?</li> <li>There was no options menu to change the settings.</li> </ul> <p>For all these problems, we provided an appropriate solution:</p> <ul> <li>The logo on the main page is smaller and moved to the top right corner.</li> <li>The logo of the plug-in is more compact. The disadvantage of this solution is the fact that the functionality is less clear.</li> <li>The problem of the preview was due to the fact that the prototype was on paper. We couldn&#8217;t express on paper that this preview was auto-completed after you filled in the URL of the tip. We keep in mind to test this problem with our digital prototype.</li> <li>We added functionality to manage your friends. These persons are the ones who you can Tip to and receive Tips from. Tip-It will work with friend requests that will have to be accepted or denied. This also solves the problem that people are afraid of being spammed.</li> <li>We provided a button to adjust your settings like your name or password.</li> </ul> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag0041.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" alt=""IMAG0041"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag0041.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a></p> <h3><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Second Iteration</span></h3> <p>With these changes included, we tested our prototype on another three test-persons. There came up some small remarks, like for example a missing cancel button. But the main problem was the new friends functionality. The users didn&#8217;t understand what the purpose of the little cross and the small logo next to user&#8217;s names was (tipping them and removing them as friend).? We will consider this problem in the next iteration of our prototype (digital or on paper).</p> <p><a href=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag00411.jpg""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-87 aligncenter"" alt=""IMAG0041"" src=""http://teamschi.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/imag00411.jpg?w=300&#038;h=169"" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a></p> <p>The interesting thing about the second iteration was that the new big problems were only discovered on the new functionality. This functionality was actually just tested for the first time, so it makes perfectly sense that the big remarks were due to this part of the application.</p> <p>Next, we will digitalize our prototype!

Using the <a title=""Think-aloud protocol"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol"" target=""_blank"">think-aloud protocol</a>, we conducted an evaluation with six different users.</p> <p>These are the most important problems and remarks by our test users:</p> <ul> <li>confused by lack of login button;</li> <li>not immediately obvious what the search function does;</li> <li>user doesn&#8217;t know if anything happened due to lack of feedback after suggesting or requesting;</li> <li>suggestion type (movie, book, series) shown only when searching, not in activity stream.</li> </ul> <p>In addition there were some minor remarks as well:</p> <ul> <li>only one genre can be selected;</li> <li>no clear distinction between the functions of the &#8216;back&#8217; and &#8216;cancel&#8217; buttons;</li> <li>function of navigation bar somewhat unclear.</li> </ul> <p>We also asked the opinion of our test users, their thoughts on our app after testing it. These are their general thoughts:</p> <ul> <li>clear;</li> <li>quite clear;</li> <li>easy to use;</li> <li>looks nice;</li> <li>bit complex due to similar looking screens;</li> <li>good.</li> </ul> <p>While these thoughts don&#8217;t have any explicit value to improve our user interface, implicitly, it serves as a reference to check if we can achieve the goals we have set with <a title=""Storyboard"" href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/brainstormstoryboard/"" target=""_blank"">our storyboard</a>.</p> <p>Overall, we think some of the more important issues with our user interface surfaced thanks to these user tests. However, we ask ourselves some questions. Should we blindly adapt our interface to solve any problem encountered by our test users? Are some types of problems found just because our testers are accustomed to programming? How much does the average user care if the functional difference between the <em>back</em> and <em>cancel</em> buttons isn&#8217;t clear straight off the bat? If we change the interface to solve some of the problems, does the result reflect the goal we&#8217;re trying to reach and can it be identified with our storyboard?</p> <p>Sure, some of these questions are rhetorical, but we think it&#8217;s detrimental to the design process of our user interface to take these into account in order to take the right decisions.</p> "	2013/03/15 02:17:23 PM

We decided to let the first batch of test users do the following three tasks. These tasks were chosen because they represent the most relevant use cases.</p> <ul> <li>Search for the frituur in a maximal distance of 3 km and that has the highest rating given by your friends.</li> <li>You ate fries at u2018frituur patjeu2019 and you liked them a lot. Give that frituur a positive rating and recommend it to one of your friends.</li> <li>Try to find whether you have new recommendations.</li> </ul> <p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the first usability problems to accumulate. Let us summarize?the issues and how we intend to cope with them below.</p> <p>1) A recurring problem with rating a frituur came up. You can see in the screen below that a user can give either +1 or -1.</p> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob1.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-42"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob1.png?w=710"" /></a></p> <p>After the user pressed the u2018+1u2019-button, that button would get a green color and the user has to press the rate-button to finalize his review. The problem we identified was that users pressed the u2018+1u2019-button and were waiting for the next screen, without thinking they should press the rate-button at the end.</p> <p>We asked the test-users about this and they would find it better that the review is finalized immediately after pressing the u2018+1u2019-button. A risk with this approach could be that users accidently press the u2018+1u2019-button and that their rating is not correct. But this scenario can be identified by using u2018Google analyticsu2019 in the digital prototype (for example: if a rating is given within 0.5 seconds by 80% of the users).</p> <p>2) The screen for u2018mijn aanbevelingenu2019 does not give very much added value since our application will be linked to Facebook. We wanted the user to give a central place to see its recommendations. But we a better approach could be to share your rating with friends on Facebook, by posting a notification on their wall or on your own wall. This has the advantage that friends of your friends can notice the wall-notification and start using our application themselves. The recommendation list will be replaced by a list of the shared ratings your friends did.</p> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob2.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-45"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob2.png?w=639"" /></a></p> <p>It could be in the future that users want an overview of all the recommendations they have done so far. If we feel that the need for this functionality is rising, we can update our application to support this overview (again). But we would like to keep our application as simple as possible.</p> <p>3) Another issue was the visualization of a rating. We chose to display a rating in two ways: a bar that indicates the percentage of the votes and the amounts of positive and negative votes (as shown in the left part of the image below). The problem is that the percentage bar of a frituur with +5 and -1 ratings has the same length of the bar of a frituur with +300 and -40 ratings. The bar gives no information about the amount of ratings, which could be misleading to the user.</p> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob3.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-47"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/prob3.png?w=552"" /></a></p> <p>We decided to display the percentage-bar in a different way: by centering the central point of green/red, the user can notice a difference in length. With this approach, we might have to rescale some bars in order to be able to display it within the screen dimensions.</p> <p>These are the most important problems we identified by iterating over our paper prototype. The final version looks like this:</p> <p><a href=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/overview.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-52"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chiconcarne.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/overview.jpg?w=328"" /></a></p> <p>Thank you fellow students and teaching assistants for all your insight!</p> <p>If you think the way we identified issues and adapted our prototype in response was good/bad/could be improved, feel free to leave a comment.</p> "	2013/03/15 03:48:29 PM

When choosing a name for an application, it shouldn&#8217;t be just a name, it has to reflect the function and feeling of the app as well.</p> <p>A name for an application to allow someone to recommend something to someone else should express its main function, namely the recommending function. Quite some synonyms or closely related words exist for <em>recommend </em>in the context of our application, but it&#8217;s necessary to take the connotation into account. We want to choose a name that resonates with the users and expresses the same feeling as <a title=""Storyboard"" href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/brainstormstoryboard"" target=""_blank"">our storyboard</a>: the app can be used to recommend things to friends, but those friends shouldn&#8217;t be feeling obliged to follow that recommendation.</p> <p>Force, impose, recommend, advise, suggest,&#8230; While any of these words could do the job, we think <em>advise</em> feels less strict, more optional if you wish, than <em>recommend</em>, but it&#8217;s easier to pronounce than words like <em>suggest</em> and <em>suggestion</em>.</p> <p>uAdvise?emphasizes the bifunctional purpose of our app: the <em>u</em>, referring to <em>you</em>, implies the interaction between people, as the app can be used to either give an advice yourself or request?advice from?a friend. In a way, using this name for our application feels like we&#8217;re taunting the user in a playful way to use our app: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you advise us to watch or read something you like?&#8221;</p> <p><a href=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/uadvise.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-120"" alt=""uAdvise"" src=""http://hatchi13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/uadvise.png?w=450"" /></a></p> "	2013/03/19 03:39:22 PM

Another remark that was put forward was that it was unclear how the username would be chosen: whether or not it should be unique, or if it is linked to the phone number, how it would be possible to find other users and know who is who while minimizing privacy concerns. One of the solutions proposed was to use an e-mail address or google account.</p> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>As there weren&#8217;t any significant issues found in the second version of the paper prototype, a next step would be to create a digital prototype of the application. The problem of chosing a username may still be an issue.

Twittet is important for us because we will use it?as a backend-service. With Twitter we don&#8217;t need to worry about storing our users, recommendations,&#8230; Also, most of the people already have a Twitter account and we can use it to let them sign in with our app. But the main reason is that we also wanted to work with hashtags to easily filter your recommendations. This seemed as a out of scope feature because it needed extra handling, but with Twitter it is build in. So this is really nice!<br /> Here you can see a nice example of the working together of Tiggzi and Twitter.<br /> You can easily link the variables of Twitter with the interface builder of Tiggzi.<br /> <a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/selection_422.png""><img class=""size-full wp-image"" id=""i-316"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/selection_422.png?w=650"" /></a></p> <p>If we manage to get a free standard plan like team LPG then we could keep everything in Tigzi, otherwise we will migrate to Android SDK in Eclipse. Because Tiggzi can export a project to this format without any effort!</p> <p>For the moment we have the tow mayor screens made, some screens to make it clear:</p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Explore screen (the searching of hashtags already works!) :</span></p> <p>You see that the buttons still need to find a nice icon, but they should represent : favorite/following and share (retweet,reply,..)<br /> It is still work in progress <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> !</p> <p><a href=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/explore1.png""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-346"" alt=""explore"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/explore1.png?w=175&#038;h=300"" width=""175"" height=""300"" /></a></p> <p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Recommend screen:</span></p> <p><img class="" wp-image alignnone"" id=""i-321"" alt=""Image"" src=""http://chinterest.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/recommend.png?w=234&#038;h=388"" width=""234"" height=""388"" /></p> <p>So, that&#8217;s that, off course we need to work more on the backend and the graphics, more on that next time! You guys think we made the right choice of picking Tiggzi, you all are working with the same tool if developing an app?

The only thing we got stuck on, was the fact that Tiggzi&#8217;s free plan only allowed us to create an application consisting of 3 pages. We tried putting stuff together on the same page, to try and get everything on those 3 precious pages.</p> <p>Eventually, we noticed this wasn&#8217;t going to work, so we decided to email Tiggzi&#8217;s support desk and ask them for a free Standard plan, which would allow us to create an unlimited amount of pages. Surprisingly, they granted our request, so now team LPG has a Standard plan for free (:</p> <p>From here on, developing went a lot better, as you can see in the image of the Explore-screen of our application:</p> <p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-91"" alt=""ExploreScreen"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/explorescreen.png?w=184&#038;h=300"" width=""184"" height=""300"" /></p> <p>Further we also choose a name and created a logo for our application:</p> <p><a href=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/logo.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-92"" alt=""logo"" src=""http://lpg13.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/logo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200"" width=""300"" height=""200"" /></a></p> <p>We&#8217;re looking forward to testing our digital prototype in class Tuesday, to see how usable it really is !</p> "	2013/03/21 06:14:17 PM

The first task was to recommend a steakhouse in Leuven to Carl using a picture. For the second task, the user had to search recommendations of concerts at his current location with the highest rating, recommended by a friend. These tests resulted in the following remarks and solutions, listed by descending importance:</p> <ol> <li>The function of the? &#8220;What are friends recommending&#8221;-button was confusing and had some overlap with both the Share and Ask functionality. Our first solution for this problem was a refactoring of the name to &#8220;Recommendations by friends&#8221; which showed both recommendations by friends and recommendations directed to the user, but with a clear separation. However, this solution imposed a problem when the user did not have any recommendations by friends yet. Therefore we renamed the button to &#8220;Recent recommendations&#8221; which shows a complete feed along with a few filters and sorting options.</li> <li>The users expected an auto-complete feature for the &#8220;To&#8221; field in the Share screen which showed the available contains. This auto-complete features is now implemented to show the user&#8217;s contacts in alphabetical order along with an option to share with everyone.</li> <li>The &#8220;What&#8221; field and the &#8220;Keywords&#8221; field made the users unsure on where to put which information while sharing. Two possible options were to drop the &#8220;Keywords&#8221; field or to only display it when relevant, based on what the user entered in the &#8220;What&#8221; field. We decided to simply drop the field and implement the second option if further tests demanded this.</li> <li>The result list did not show enough information about each result. We therefore decided to show more information like the location, recommender, the date of recommendation and the rating.</li> <li>Finally, the text of the share confirmation popup, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; was too confusing. It was not clear that this popup came from the Share button. Therefore we changed the text to &#8220;Share now?&#8221;.</li> </ol> <p>The result of these changes will be revealed in our next post.</p> 	2013/03/25 03:30:03 PM

To check whether the solutions of the first iteration eliminated the problems, we used the same tests as in iteration one. As we hoped, the remarks from the first iteration were not mentioned this time. Apart from a few minor remarks, no new problems arose. We therefore decided that the paper prototype has been sufficiently tested and it is time to start working on the actual digital prototype.</p> 	2013/03/25 04:15:42 PM

Some of the more important benefits of creating paper prototypes are:</p> <ul> <li>no time is wasted with programming to conclude a certain design doesn&#8217;t work;</li> <li>way quicker than using a digital prototype;</li> <li>(quite) easy to change something when using paper;</li> <li>it hurts less to start from scratch when not pleased with an interface design.</li> </ul> <p>Like with all things, paper prototypes have some negative aspects as well:</p> <ul> <li>no exact representation of the design as it would look on the device it&#8217;s developed for, i.e. size of buttons, icons,&#8230; differs from its digital counterpart;</li> <li>it takes a bit more time to draw if icons are to be used;</li> <li>specific gestures like scrolling can&#8217;t be reproduced accurately using a paper prototype;</li> <li>it looks bland, it isn&#8217;t immediately obvious if elements are clickable or not and whether some elements are buttons or not.</li> </ul> <p>To us, the pros outweigh the cons of using a paper protype, but serious caution is needed when using this paper prototype to conduct tests. That&#8217;s where things could potentially get ugly. A delicate balance needs to be found between creating a simple prototype and adding enough details to simulate a realistic feeling. Providing too much detail in a paper prototype would nullify its goal to minimize initial design time. Not enough detail leads to an unrepresentative look and feel of the user interface. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing to ignore remarks and comments on things like scrolling, the colours used, etc to a certain degree, without becoming completely ignorant about major design flaws.</p> <p>The sooner the switch is made from paper prototyping to a digital version, the better, but <em>only</em> after the main problems with the paper prototype are solved. Minor problems can easily be addressed during a next stage of the design process and, depending on the kind of problems, will even solve themselves if the interface is tested on the device it&#8217;s developed for, as there&#8217;s only so much one can achieve using a paper prototype.</p> "	2013/03/26 07:48:53 PM

Secondly we want to identify possible new problems due to the digital prototype.</p> <p>A small recap about last iteration: Users had to much doubt when using our application because there were many icons and ways to do many things (a scope creep). Our solution was to strip down the functionality and return to the core of recommending something to someone. Only one problem could not be solved with this. Namely the confusion between: &#8220;for you&#8221; and &#8220;for me&#8221;. The first means recommendations that you make and the latter means recommendations that you receive. We tried to solve this by renaming it to respectively: &#8220;from me&#8221; and &#8220;for me&#8221;.</p> <p>Now about the very first digital prototype. Because we work with twitter you will be able to explore tweets and see all tweets that mention you (actually me, pj_verbruggen). You can also post a tweet if you sign in with Twitter. Very simple, very basic and good news: you can check it out yourself right <a title=""prototype"" href=""http://project.tiggzi.com/mobile-frame?src=http://project.tiggzi.com/view/95b81167-e947-4b76-9a89-49a70c511637/Homepage.html&amp;type=mobile"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a> !</p> <p>Our test case (feel free to test this yourself and report back into the comment section):</p> <ol> <li>What do you expect if you read &#8220;from me&#8221; and &#8220;for me&#8221;?</li> <li>Search for recommendations (tweets) that contain x-men</li> <li>Which recommendations did you receive</li> <li>Make a recommendation</li> </ol> <p>We tested this on 2 people. Everything went fine except for three remarks:</p> <ul> <li>If you read &#8220;from me&#8221; you expect a list of recommendations that you made</li> <li>To make a new recommendation you choose &#8220;from me&#8221; but it is a negative choice (a choice after an elimination of other options)</li> <li>The explore button is too much, it looks not like a button but more like a title.</li> </ul> <p>So we still got some work to fix this last things, once our core is working great, we will start adding more and more features!</p> <p>Please feel free to test our app and make comments! What do you think of the names, the home screen, the icons?</p> <p>By the way: In addition to the discussion about sixth sense, google glass and future concepts.

This way we could make it clear to the reader of this documentation what we saw during these tests, what we concluded from these results and which changes we made to our application in light of these conclusions.</p> <p>For the tests in each iteration, there are five steps:</p> <ul> <li>the goal of the test</li> <li>the ?testing method we applied</li> <li>why we used a certain method</li> <li>who was tested and where</li> <li>the bare results (no interpretation) of the tests</li> <li>finally which problems were discovered by analyzing the results.</li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, at the beginning of each iteration it is important to indicate which problems we will address in that iteration, the possible alternatives that can be a solution for the problems and finally which of these solutions we choose and why for each problem.</p> <p>The problems that come forward when testing our paper prototype can be read in a previous?<a href=""http://lpg13.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/testing-our-paper-prototype/"">blog post</a>. There are also some solutions suggested in this post.</p> <p>At the end of the session we also designed the test for our first digital prototype. We will use 2 type of tests. First, we will let the user think-aloud when executing tasks and we will count the number of clicks that is necessary to finish each task in a correct way. Secondly, we will time some other test users to get some measures of how much time the different tasks we propose take.</p> <p>The results of these tests will, on one hand, let us make new changes in the user interface if people still have interface-related problems with the different tasks.</p> <p>On the other hand, the efficiency test (counting the clicks and timing) will give us information about how much effort the users need to do for completing each task. If this is to high for most users, we will need to rethink the design, so we can reduce the needed effort.</p> <p>During the two weeks, in which there will be no session, we will find as much test users as possible, so the conclusions we get of these tests are real problems for most users and not just outliers.</p> <p>We will also post a link here shortly, so you guys can test our digital prototype and give us feedback if you have any !</p> "	2013/03/27 04:01:41 PM

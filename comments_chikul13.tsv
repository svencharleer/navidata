When I clicked on the button, it opens a new page, but there I cannot immediately see a &#8216;go-back&#8217;-button in the left upper corner like all the other screens have (the same buttons as on most iOS applications). This was bothering me because I just wanted to take a look to the page behind that button and go back to the application again. I would like it if the google plugin-page is more integrated into the layout of the application: so that for example the blue upper-bar is still visible when giving feedback (including a &#8216;go-back&#8217;-button).</p> 	2013/04/12 01:01:40 PM

If this is normal because I&#8217;ve never recommend something before, it would be useful to display a little sentence like: &#8220;You have never recommend something yet.&#8221; I think that just an empty screen can give the user a feeling that the application is not responding. Or what do you think about this?<br /> - a little bug: when I want to recommend something, the comment textfield states that I have still 140 characters left. When I add one more char to the field, the counter is lowered to 54 <img src='https://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /><br /> - On the home screen is a button with a configuration icon. Does it still need to be implemented? (it does nothing when clicking on it)</p> 	2013/04/12 02:02:29 PM

The last conclusion doesn&#8217;t quite convince met tough. I know that the assignment was only to test 3 persons and that makes it hard to see if a result is not representative or not. Do you plan to do this test again on a larger test group in a later iteration to see if it still may be a problem or do you expect this to not be a problem? 1 out of 3 seen in percentages is still a large amount <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> 	2013/04/15 10:47:55 AM

I tested it on Tiggzi so I am a bit confused, because you mention paper prototypes in the blog and a first digital prototype?<br /> Anyway, I (still) like the digital prototype, it looks very clean and tight. Although you only use the default icons in Tiggzi it seems to be enough to get a nice look. I also like the colors, they are very calm, not too much contrast but just enough to see the difference between components.</p> <p>I also think the like and dislike option should be in the overview. Because you want to rate stuff while you are exploring and you also want to see how it has been rated. It requires too much effort if you need to open a specific recommendation. But I also agree with your motivation regarding the problem,, more evaluation will tell you what is best..</p> 	2013/04/16 09:49:32 AM

Because I have to say that a complete report was way too much information for me. I saw that you choose for facebook icons because they have a well-known function. That&#8217;s a good idea, popular social media have the power to set standards for icons and terms, so it is good for small, new apps to copy the style and behavior so that users won&#8217;t be confused.</p> 	2013/04/16 10:04:45 AM

The way you wrote it is more an interpretation of the results than the raw results themselves. For example result 5: how do you know they understood it? Was it because they said so, or just because they didn&#8217;t mention any problems. Was it clear because you asked them to do a specific thing? The question might have pushed the user into an interpretation (one of the disadvantages of this kind of test). So for next time you might consider posting the raw data and then what your conclusions from that data is.</p> 	2013/04/17 05:43:49 PM

And the boxplots really give some insight in the responses, but I was a bit confused with the scaling of the boxplots. For example, the boxplot at u2018I think that I would like to use this system frequentlyu2019 looks like most people give it a very low score, while the minimum is actually 3 (of 5). It might be interesting to put all the boxplots on the same scale?</p> 	2013/04/20 11:49:21 AM

We actually thought of that ourselves before publishing this blog post. However, it&#8217;s quite difficult to find a good application that allows us to draw box plots easily, gives a nice-looking output and provides us with sufficient tools to adapt the scale etc.</p> <p>It still baffles me that applications like Excel and OpenOffice&#8217;s Calc let us draw the most useless graph types, but unless you use some rather complicated, tedious and cumbersome tricks, there&#8217;s no way to draw a box plot and get the freedom we want to easily adjust the output.</p> <p>We&#8217;re still looking for one, but &#8211; following the theme of our apps &#8211; maybe you or someone else could recommend us a quick and simple box plot tool&#8230;?</p> 	2013/04/20 12:50:03 PM

Personally, I&#8217;m much more interested in your critical analyses of the data. You can then use snippets of the data to build your argument.

However, I feel the main problem is that you expected to read something else in this post. The conclusions and applied solutions will be discussed in an other post (coming very soon). We&#8217;d like to think of this iteration report as some kind of user evaluation report, a post to collect all information about the conducted tests.</p> <p>This blog post is written is such a way that you could simply skip the &#8216;results&#8217; section and only read our conclusions, without missing out on critical information. Every problem mentioned in the conclusion section is a summary of some sorts, referring to the numbered results, which we use both as &#8216;arguments&#8217; for a certain conclusion and as a more in-depth explanation of the problem.</p> <p>I could imagine that you&#8217;re not interested to read all different remarks by our test users, but we chose to use this approach for two reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, a problem mentioned by &#8216;just&#8217; one test user can&#8217;t be simply ignored. That&#8217;s ignoring about 16.7% of our test users&#8230; This doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll change every little problem found by our testers, we just feel it&#8217;s necessary to mention it in this evaluation report, to provide you with an unbiased view of the current status of our design.</p> <p>Secondly, consistently not mentioning smaller remarks of just one test user could be problematic if the same problem is found by one person during each iteration. That would be quite a few test users overall. By mentioning them in this post, we can easily refer to them if the same problems occur in following iterations.</p> <p>Also, about the length of our blog 	2013/04/27 12:02:16 AM

Pushing out new versions will take a week each time as well, but combined with the real-life user tests, I think this is a limitation we can overcome.</p> 	2013/04/29 12:47:12 PM

I like the use of arrows to see if a message is incoming or outgoing, and it could be just me, but I expected the arrow in the right direction to be for incoming and left for outgoing. Maybe using a curved arrow could prevent this to be misinterpreted.</p> <p>As a side note, it took me a while to find which picture showed which problem. It could help to number them in future blog posts.</p> 	2013/04/29 09:08:54 PM

Makes it easy to remember the url.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve played around for a bit with the app and got some (hopefully) helpful comments.</p> <p>- The biggest issue I had with the app was the explore function. If it wasn&#8217;t for the older comments on this blog post, I still wouldn&#8217;t know what its function is.</p> <p>- The first time you look at a recommendation in the detailed overview, a map is shown with the location in the middle of it, but opening detailed views after that always shows the location at the upper left op the map. Even if it&#8217;s the same recommendation.</p> <p>- I know the app adapts to the browser&#8217;s window size, but when opened at max size, the buttons look really long&#8230; especially on bigger screens. Maybe you could force the user/browser to open a new window with fixed dimensions? Because I&#8217;ve seen some screenshots in your other posts and that looks a lot better to me.</p> <p>- Just a minor remark, but personally, I prefer to have as little tabs/windows opened as possible at the same time. I need to close the SignIn tab myself after I&#8217;m logged in.</p> <p>- At last something even less important, but using Internet Explorer, the &#8216;Login with Facebook&#8217; button has the same colour as the &#8216;About&#8217; button, but with white letters, making it almost impossible to read. The blue button looks fine with Google Chrome though <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p> <p>I hope my comments will be helpful.

To me, both the first and third approach to show the votes are clear. Using the third alternative however, I&#8217;m just wondering how you&#8217;d handle the bar size for items with a lot of votes. I suppose there&#8217;s a limit to the bar&#8217;s size, so, from my understanding, it has the same problem as the first method.</p> 	2013/04/30 04:23:42 PM

I agree that the figure might be difficult to read at first, but I thought it gave a better overview on which questions score better, and on which we need to focus more. I was also bearing in mind that a colored graphic is easy in comparison with next iterations: more green left and more red right means better than before. (The reason we make a differentiation between odd and even question (left and right) comes from the SUS calculation, and is not really our choice.)</p> <p>Thanks for the tip, we&#8217;ll keep it in mind! <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> 	2013/05/02 11:55:49 PM

We wanted to get started with testing the app&#8217;s core functions as quickly as possible, so we went with a simple prototype (no pictures) and a &#8216;standard&#8217; colour scheme.</p> <p>We always felt the old look was a bit lacking and didn&#8217;t really stay true to what we tried to achieve with the app. We carefully adjusted the style without changing the positions of buttons and other elements.</p> <p>Aside from the reasons stated in this post, we think that showing Facebook pictures adds a familiar, comfortable feeling of meeting someone you know, making it less &#8216;scary&#8217;, more feeling at home using the app. This is more in accordance with our storyboard/concept.</p> <p>Unlike the old look, we&#8217;re very passionate about this new look and we pay special attention to make sure this visual upgrade doesn&#8217;t introduce new problems.</p> 	2013/05/02 11:10:13 PM

The two buttons &#8216;Archive&#8217; and &#8216;New status&#8217; are between a status and the replies on that status.

Then there would have been an extra button &#8220;show replies&#8221; next to these buttons, so it would have made more sense as a whole.<br /> If I can get the layout right with this jQuery mobile stuff, it will probably resemble the Facebook wall a bit more.</p> 	2013/05/04 02:10:07 PM

It may seem redundant at first as I know what&#8217;s my login name, but somehow it makes it more personal, so I think it was a great decision to show the login name.</p> <p>I also really like the search function. Most search functions have a set minimal number of characters a search should have, but with RecoTweet you can even search for messages containing only an exclamation mark (&#8216;!&#8217;). It&#8217;s only too bad that user names, urls and tags aren&#8217;t included in the search. It could be useful to search for all urls containing &#8216;youtube&#8217; for instance.</p> <p>I got a few remarks after using the app:<br /> - Right now it&#8217;s not much of a problem as there aren&#8217;t many recommendations, but it requires more scrolling to read new messages as new ones are added at the bottom of the list.<br /> - There isn&#8217;t some kind of suggestion list or autocompletion when typing the user name of whom you want to sent your recommendation to; it forces the user to learn the exact way a user name is written by heart.<br /> - The links aren&#8217;t working at the moment; don&#8217;t know for sure if it&#8217;s a small bug or just something that needs to be implemented.<br /> - Since you&#8217;re using a standalone/independent login system, maybe you should provide a tool of some sorts for people who&#8217;ve forgotten their passwords. (I created an account a week ago and almost forgot mine when logging in now&#8230;)</p> <p>Overall, I like the app. To me, it&#8217;s main functions are clear and it&#8217;s quite easy to use. Keep up the good work!</p> 	2013/05/07 01:15:31 AM

But auto-completion does not scale very well in our scenario. With Facebook it works because it&#8217;s a environment of friends, but here it is more like Twitter; the explore functionality is central, and therefore I think auto-completion is not a good idea.<br /> - Indeed, the links are not working, we will fix this soon!<br /> - Account recovery is definitely a must-have feature but less important for the GUI, so we will put it on the list and see if we get to it.</p> 	2013/05/07 08:51:20 AM

Also, using SUS (which gave you an incredibly good result) is something i think we&#8217;l be using as well. Since you got these good results, it probably isn&#8217;t very useful to further test the current functionalities. Adding new ones at this stage thus is definitely a good idea.</p> 	2013/05/07 04:27:12 PM

Only a few buttons and the meaning of it was very clear to me.<br /> But I also have some remarks:</p> <p>- During the creation of an account, it was a bit weird that you didn&#8217;t have to repeat your password. Normally you have to enter your password twice. Personally I find it safer to let the user repeat its password, because if he/she makes a mistake without noticing it, the password is saved wrongly. This could be avoided by repeating the password.</p> <p>- When a user has created a new account, the login screen appears again. Maybe it would be better to log in that newly created user automatically after pressing the &#8220;sign up&#8221;-button? I think when a user creates an account, he/she wants to use the app right away.</p> <p>- This is just a small detail, but the error message, which appear when entering a faulty username or password, could be unclear to users who don&#8217;t know what a database is.</p> <p>- Showing the login name of the user is a good idea. I agree with Dimitri Vargemidis that it makes it more personal.</p> 	2013/05/07 09:31:38 PM

However the username does not require extra space, each page has a heading by default. The user name is also only visible in the homescreen where space is not an issue so I cannot agree with this argument. Thanks for the comment!</p> 	2013/05/07 11:18:13 PM

However, due to the brevity of the explanation, not all rationales were clear to me.</p> <p>Also, as you did the transition from paper to digital prototype, I think it&#8217;s important to show a few screenshots of the app.</p> <p>I know it was done by ways of a poll, but in the end it&#8217;s entirely up to you, so I think it was a good decision to use an existing system for users to log in. Somehow, to me, it&#8217;s like an existing system can be trusted a bit more in terms of security of passwords and other personal data.</p> 	2013/05/08 02:35:42 PM

It&#8217;s no use to keep going on with a certain method if you notice it doesn&#8217;t deliver the kind of results you wanted. For iteration 3, we asksed our users to play around with our app as well, but it turned out pretty good. Maybe you could try to ask them subtly to play around with the app, but to try and use all functionalities without giving any specific tasks. If a certain important function isn&#8217;t found/used, it could indicate that it&#8217;s a bit too well-hidden.</p> 	2013/05/08 02:51:39 PM

Don&#8217;t get me wrong: it&#8217;s cool that you&#8217;ve gotten so many test users; it also gives you more representative poll results, but it could be possible to get the same results with less effort on your end.</p> <p>Also, you&#8217;ve asksed your users to choose between words like &#8216;simple&#8217; and &#8216;complex&#8217; and while it gives you an indication of their opinion, I think it would give you a better idea of their opinion if you&#8217;d use a SUS questionnaire. That way, they could say for instance they agree for 75% that the app is simple. By giving them just two choices, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s &#8216;all or nothing&#8217;.</p> <p>By the way, I&#8217;ve also tried your app, and it looks really good! I particulary think the colours used in the app really fit the concept.</p> 	2013/05/08 03:52:37 PM

Regarding the extra message that you send for advertisement. It is a very good idea that you check whether the user is already using uAdvise. But maybe an option is that after the recommendation, you add a small text like &#8216;sended with uAdvise&#8217;. People can then still remove it but often they let it as it is. This is the same strategy as is done by Apple with their Ipads where they put &#8216;Sended from my Ipad/Iphone&#8217; after an e-mail. The main advantage is that it requires effort to remove it and it avoids the extra delay of a second message..</p> 	2013/05/09 06:18:01 PM

The quality of this post was a really big improvement over the previous posts. I do have a bit of a problem with finding those previous tests on your blog. Either I&#8217;m just not looking in the right place, or you modified them in such a way that I no longer recognize them as being the same.</p> <p>I do have a slight problem with the result in test 4 though. Mostly with the exact meaning of those numbers. I was there during the class so I got a vague idea about how it went. As it shows now it looks like there were 36 people, each picking one of the 4 options. I know there aren&#8217;t that many students (about 24 now?) Or did that mean that only only 12 people actually wanted an existing system, and if everyone had to chose, 10 would go for FB, 9 for Gmail? (where there 19 people voting?) So you might need to reword that a little bit to make it clear.</p> 	2013/05/14 01:52:05 AM

If you want to dig a bit deeper into google analytics, you can set up a path through your application and get conversion rate graphs. This would also give you nice overviews on where in the process the user gives up (what specific page needs work etc).</p> <p>The evolution screenshots are a nice touch!</p> 	2013/05/15 08:47:57 AM

Showing or hiding own posts is not a primary function as we&#8217;re not trying to recreate a mailbox feeling with the activity stream (with seperate incoming and outgoing views), but more something like Twitter or a chatbox, with incoming and outgoing posts mingled (chronologically).</p> <p>By adding this show/hide option as an extra feature, there is room for the users to &#8216;explore&#8217; a bit. We consider this to be a playful approach and hope it offers some kind of rewarding, satisfactory feeling when users find out about this feature after their second, third,&#8230; time they use the app, triggering some kind of reaction like: &#8220;Cool, I didn&#8217;t know that was possible too&#8221;.</p> <p>Long story short, no harm&#8217;s done if a user won&#8217;t find out about this option, but if he does, it could be a motivating, refreshing incentive to keep using the app, showing that the app isn&#8217;t &#8216;shallow&#8217;, that it&#8217;s has multiple layers of usage.</p> 	2013/05/15 09:29:48 PM

Although I really enjoyed the fast actions on the phone, this is maybe too fast for external people? The tempo is really high which is great for advertising but maybe for your demo you will have to lower it so that people can follow it more easily. Or an introduction to the app could maybe also help so that people get the idea behind the app in advance.</p> 	2013/05/16 09:09:54 AM

And logo&#8217;s aren&#8217;t that easy to draw (:</p> <p>You also make a good point about the color-grading display. Actually this is a trade-off. On one hand, by using images or buttons to indicate a recommendation was liked or disliked, you have more possible colour-schemes for your application.

It gives a very &#8216;clean&#8217; impression which, in my understanding, is important in a modern user interface. However, i have my doubts about the navigation buttons: I don&#8217;t believe the text in them will scale well on mobile devices. An alternative would be to work with some icons perhaps? When designing our own interface, we also had the idea to use colour-grading to display whether it is a good or bad recommendation, but in the end we decide not to use it, since it kind of limits the possible colour-schemes of your application. We might be completely wrong on that point however, so i&#8217;m excited to see how that will work out in the next step!</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:56 PM

I think they chose for this aggressive user recruiting process because their website needs a community to work, more users = more pins. So from that point of view I understand why it&#8217;s there, though it didn&#8217;t need to be that big <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p> <p>I don&#8217;t totally agree on your opinion about the chaotic interface, I thought that they managed to give their &#8216;core activity&#8217; the attention it needed. I don&#8217;t think Pintrest is really meant to look at every Pin, I think you just skim over and if something interesting pops out you take a look at it. This might be why they didn&#8217;t opt for a less chaotic user interface, where the Pins are contained in a grid for example. They probably just want to show as much as possible. I do agree that for a first-time user this might be a problem but I imagine people get used to it quick enough.</p> <p>We also noticed that adding a Pin might be quite confusing the first times you use it. A little explanation there would&#8217;ve been helpful.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:56 PM

These days privacy through the Internet is growing in importance and is also becoming a bigger subject in the media. Pinterest should be aware of the privacy of their users and should indeed at least warn the user explicitly about this concern when registering.<br /> I also agree with the fact that the website is a bit chaotic, users are confronted with a boom of information. But I think the idea of pinterest is to create a sphere that relates to a real pin-up board, like there is one in my kitchen. My pin-up board is also very chaotic because all the little bulletins are pinned in an unordered way. Maybe that&#8217;s why pinterest decided to go for such a design? On the other hand, it would be handy to give the user the possibility to reorder the pinned messages in an order he decides himself. But this option is not supported by pinterest.</p> <p>I also like the idea that the top-menu bar follows when scrolling down. A side note on this is that the search field is not included is this bar. This would be handy when you read a specific word in a picture (for example a, for you unknown, company name). If you are interested in that company and you want to search for it on pinterest, you have to save the word in your head and type it on top of the website (where the search fields is located). For me it looks easier to just take over the word immediately in the search field.</p> <p>Our team had the same problem with searching a person. We had the assignment to search for a certain person, but if we searched for that person, pinterest did not show any result. The result was hidden in the tab &#8216;pinners&#8217;. I can imagine that this confusing for a lot of users that use pinterest for the first time. A possible solution could be to list the results as a list and not as closed tabs.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:56 PM

I already read that on another blog, so I will repeat my answer here. <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> I also agree with the fact that the website is a bit chaotic, users are confronted with a boom of information.

On the other hand, it would be handy to give the user the possibility to reorder the pinned messages in an order he can choose himself. But this option is not supported by pinterest.</p> <p>About the scroll-up-button: I also think this is a good idea, because of the reason you already gave. An alternative would be to let the whole top-bar follow while scrolling (at the moment, only the lower part of the top-bar does this). An issue with this approach could be that the total space to show the pin-up board decreases (although it&#8217;s only an extra loose of about 30 pixels). A good point is that the you can click on an additional u2018homeu2019-button to go up the page (basically reload it) and that the search field is always visible for the user when he finds interesting words to search for (for example a name of a company which the user reads in a picture).</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t notice the problem about loading a picture where the user is blocked to do something with the requested pin-up. For most users it&#8217;s important that a system responds as fast as possible to their requests. That&#8217;s why I think this is a good point of feedback for pinterest.</p> <p>Additionally to the creating account problem, the error message was indeed only available in English, but its font size was also smaller than the fields to register. For such an error, the font size should be larger so that the user will certainly notice the error. And indeed: the message pinterest give to the user is not very helpful. It states to &#8216;try again later&#8217;. But what is later? Now? In one hour? In three days?</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:59 PM

This indicates that it might be a problem that will keep arising for other people and should be taken care of.<br /> I&#8217;m glad that you also did the test of pinning something from a specific user. In our case, the person didn&#8217;t immediately notice the option to select pinners as search results instead of pins, which you label as the &#8220;tricky part&#8221;. On the other hand, your test person already knew how to do this and the test went smoothly. Thus, it looks like it&#8217;s also a common problem that might need some further investigation.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:50:01 PM

You are totally right about the non-helpful information pinterest shows in that error message. I should also increase the font size of the message, so that a user will certainly notice the error message. But as I said, the error message is not very clear for the user.</p> <p>I can also imagine that some users do not know what to do to go back to the main page after zooming in a picture. I did not notice the background thing myself, but this can be easily solved by adding a cross &#8216;x&#8217; at the top corner of the zoomed-in image.</p> <p>For me, searching was not that easy. When searching for a specific user, the search task gave me no result (that was what I thought). It was very confusing because I knew the person I was searching for had a pinterest account. But apparently I had to navigate to the &#8216;pinners&#8217; tab, where indeed the person I was looking for appeared. I guess that a lot of (new) users are struggling with this search-issue.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:50:00 PM

But I disagree that this is a pro because it&#8217;s done automatically. You should be able to look at all the results at the same time. If you now search for a Pinner you always need to make an extra click, even if no Pin or Board results exist. I would prefer when they show the top 5 results for each category.</p> <p>The 5 pinners that you need to follow is indeed very aggressive. I think we skipped it by returning to the home page but there is no option which allows you to skip this nicely.</p> <p>You mention icon confusion regarding uploading a pin, was this the only example? I don&#8217;t really agree there, because I don&#8217;t think it is an icon problem. I just don&#8217;t like it that you need to choose between uploading a picture and giving an URL. There should be only one option &#8216;Add a Pin&#8217; and then there should be an URL field and a box to upload a picture so that you can choose there. Because &#8216;Add a Pin&#8217; and &#8216;Upload a pin&#8217; are not exclusive, in my opinion uploading a pin is a possible part of adding a pin..</p> <p>I also agree with the conclusion, we all had some good comments because we were very critical in our evaluation but I think we also need to agree that the website overall is user friendly. The main reason that nobody decided to keep using Pinterest is because we did not find it useful.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:50:02 PM

It is typical that you only get mobile app advertisement when you enter Pinterest with a mobile device. If you login with your smartphone/tablet then you will see that a remark is made to get the app from your store. This is the normal way to advertise your app.<br /> This does not mean that they could not make a link to it at their website of course. But with Facebook I would also have no idea where to find a reference to the app, it is simply quite useless to have while visiting the page with a PC/Mac.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:50:02 PM

If we look at the board now, then we see &#8216;Edit Board&#8217; in the central position. This is where the first confusion started for me, I clicked there to add pictures but it were actually board settings that I could edit there. The &#8216;Add+&#8217; button is in the top menu, next to the &#8216;About&#8217; button and it has the same size. In our opinion this was strange for the main action that will be selected.</p> <p>For me the most logical place is just the topleft pin of your board, instread of putting a real pin there, you just put a giant &#8216;+&#8217; or ADD so when you click it, you can add pins. This is a very common strategy.</p> <p>I understand that the Add+ is consistent for the whole site, but I would not find it redundant when they add this + pin in your board so that this becomes extra obvious.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:57 PM

Was your language Dutch when you entered or was it English or Portuguese?</p> <p>I totally agree with the 5 categories that you need to select problem. This is indeed for their recommendation engine so that it doesn&#8217;t suffer from the cold start problem but they could use some implicit feedback depending on the first pins that you click in a random overview so I don&#8217;t think it is necessary to be so aggressive with it.<br /> When I joined Pinterest they asked me to follow 5 pinners so this is also strange. If I had to choose between boards and pinners I would go for boards because I really had no idea which Pinners made which Pins so I did not know who I wanted to follow. With a board you can choose some topic you like but then indeed you have the problem that you don&#8217;t know who the Pinner is.. So I conclude that the best option is that they don&#8217;t force you to follow anything. They could just suggest you to follow some artists or idols, but not more than a suggestion.</p> <p>So except for the error message and the pick 5 categories obligation you think that Pinterest is intuitive? I don&#8217;t completely agree with that one, for example the Add button is not so easy to find and the choice of uploading a pin and adding a pin is somewhat strange, isn&#8217;t uploading a pin also adding a pin?</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:58 PM

But not on a single page that is called &#8216;mobile apps&#8217; or something. You have to go to the &#8220;pin it button&#8221;-page where you normally can learn how to use their &#8220;pin it&#8221;-button, but the first thing you see on that page are their mobile apps instead of the usage/tutorials for the button.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:50:02 PM

I noticed this today because I deleted my account yesterday. Itu2019s like you may not browse it when you are not a real pinner. I also take your point on the fact that the overview is too busy. I think it&#8217; s because of the blobs of text. A good alternative would be to show the text after you clicked the pin. In essence itu2019s about sharing pictures, does that mean that I don&#8217;t want to read some explanation? No, but they could limit it to 100 characters.</p> <p>Pinterest indeed addresses you in the correct language, but if you press a menu button you switch back to English.

The first screenshot clearly indicates that. Apparently Pinterest decided to go even further. The current user interface for non-registered users doesn&#8217;t even allow them to browse the site. The only options are to log in or to register.</p> <p>When I was browsing the site during the session last week I also noticed that other users were not displayed in the search results. While this issue may lower user experience, I don&#8217;t think this is an interface problem.</p> <p>I take your point that for new Pinterest users the tile-like interface can be overwhelming. However I think that for frequent Pinterest users this interface is quite effective, because it maximizes the amount of information the user gets on one screen.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:56 PM

In my opinion the search options &#8220;Pins&#8221;, &#8220;Boards&#8221; and &#8220;Pinners&#8221; are not so obvious. When you search something, the screen gets filled with images which are a lot larger than the text displaying the different search options.

The user is able to quickly find a way to create a board and add a new pin. Features that are less frequently used could be hard to find on the website.

The &#8216;no criticism&#8217; rule prevents discouraging great and original ideas. It&#8217;s just not easy to suppress the natural reflex of trying to maintain a critical mind.</p> <p>I actually take the &#8216;unstructured&#8217; part as a compliment. We got lots of different ideas during the brainstorm and wrote them all down when they came, like I think a brainstorm should be. It may sound a bit cheap to put it this way, but the way the notes were structured was entirely up to the person taking notes. Someone else taking notes could result in a very different look of our brainstorm&#8217;s notes, but the ideas would be exactly the same. Ultimately, the only thing that really matters is that a brainstorm brings forth a lot of ideas.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:59 PM

That&#8217;s why I think the concept behind Pinterest most certainly has its charm. However, when looking at the pin board in your kitchen, you can see it in its entirety due to its limited size. In one view, you can see what the important messages are, the groceries, reminders,&#8230;</p> <p>Pinterest doesn&#8217;t provide that luxury of seeing the big picture in one look. If the pin board in your kitchen had a size of about two by two meters, you&#8217;d have to come with a better way of pinning messages to prevent missing an important note.</p> <p>I think that&#8217;s the major flaw with Pinterest. I like the playfulness of a chaotic pin board, but I want the freedom to order anything the way I want.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:59 PM

This is in my opinion one of the most important factors contributing to the chaos.</p> <p>As a user who just pinned a new picture on Pinterest, I don&#8217;t know whether it will be added to the top or the bottom of my pin board (or maybe randomly somewhere in the middle). This is in contrast with for instance Twitter: new posts are added to the top (so I don&#8217;t need to scroll all the way down to see the newest stuff like on Pinterest). I can easily choose which one&#8217;s tweets I want to see and let&#8217;s say the last time I read any new tweets was about 24 hours ago, I know exactly where I left off and where to pick up on any new messages.</p> <p>For me that&#8217;s the reason I think Pinterest is inferior to other similar social media.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:59 PM

It&#8217;s very nice!</p> <p>Brainstorming: I like the focus on things were you can make a picture of and locations. If you look at FourSquare it would be definitely be possible to add some cool features regarding locations. But maybe this is too far from the original purpose&#8230;</p> <p>Storyboarding: I totally agree that recommending people to people will be misused, it is a shame though because it could be cool if everybody had good intentions. The storyboards are well made in my opinion, I liked the triangle and the square man. Also the use of arrows between two smartphones in different pictures is very clear. Some time indications could be added, but the arrows actually make it clear that everything happens instantly.</p> <p>Prototype:<br /> + Login screen, it&#8217;s simple and clean like it should be<br /> ? Color intensities: playing with red and green is not a good idea for the color blinds and I think it will also become to intense.<br /> + I like the idea of a clear indicator of how you rated a recommendation.<br /> ? I think it should be possible to rate suggestions on the fly while you are going through your list. Now you need to go to the Suggestions Detail. I think that is too much effort<br /> + The bottom buttons are an easy and consistent way to switch between views, like Simon said you will probably need to think about icons regarding space limitations.<br /> ? The name of the screen in the top is redundant with the button information, so I think you can leave this out.</p> <p>Nice blogpost!</p> 	2013/03/02 01:31:58 PM

The main screen looks all right, but you only use one column, isn&#8217;t this a bit small for a laptop screen? I think you should use the space for multiple columns and then you don&#8217;t need the filter options in the left. This would also solve the comment of Gert about the confusions.

As I am not too familiar with all the functions that come with mobile apps, we should probably should look it into it a bit more what exactly this share functionality already does.</p> <p>We will try to add some more background to our post as to why this kind of application would be interesting!</p> 	2013/03/02 03:48:15 PM

It gives you a lot more screenspace to play with. I do agree with Pieter-Jan that there might be more that you can do with all the screen space. But it&#8217;s those things that you&#8217;ll probably find out about in the user tests.</p> <p>I hope the arrows for the incoming and outgoing recommendations will work out.

Certainly when applied to dating. But I&#8217;m wondering if your idea to recommend/rate good team mates falls in this same category. I would certainly see the merits of an app that recommends people for group works. And I think it might even motivate people to work harder so that they get good ratings and and up in a team with other people with good ratings.

I think that it&#8217;s important to build an application that does not look chaotic to possible users. The first screen is a login screen: does that mean you will not use (for example) facebook for the friendship-network and people can only use it when they are logged in with an account of your application? If that&#8217;s the case, wouldn&#8217;t you get more people using your app when they can login via facebook? It&#8217;s just something that came up in my mind, but I can also imaging that you want an application which is independent of using accounts of other social media..</p> <p>A second remark is the &#8216;explore&#8217; screen. For me the meaning of 1D &#8211; 2Y &#8211; 1Y.. is not 100% clear. Is this an indication of when they created an account, or the last time they were active?</p> <p>These are just 2 little remarks.

It really guides the user through several steps and a general overview is provided after completing a certain step. A little remark is that there is not much detail in the paper prototype. For example when finishing the first step (choosing an application), there is no button provided in the overview to delete the app and to choose another one. Or can this be done by just pushing on the name of the app? These things will get more clear after evaluating the paper prototype with test users!</p> 	2013/03/03 12:14:22 PM

I personally doubt it could be summarized and programmed into an effective app. However, certain aspects of &#8220;working&#8221; could be quantified (hours of work done, number of words written, final grade) and those metrics can be used (preferably in addition to other methods) to discover a good match between your personal style of working and those of others.</p> <p>This is a typical solution to this problem: focus on what someone does, not who does it.</p> 	2013/03/03 12:44:44 PM

At first glance, it seems tip-it doesn&#8217;t really offer anything new. However, hidden in the storyboard are some elements that I think could really distinguish Tip-it:</p> <p>*Instead of cluttering the mailbox / facebook wall, all tips could be centralized in a tip-it toolbar.<br /> *It is instantly clear if somebody recommended something new to you.<br /> *You can search your (and your friends their) history of recommendations for easy access.</p> <p>There are still some pitfalls with this kind of application. Take care in the design/develop process to deal with the following situations:</p> <p>*It&#8217;s not always funny: Do you risk your friendship by saying your friend&#8217;s cat pictures are boring?<br /> *Too much fun is unfun: Take measures to fight spammers who always send everything they see to everyone in their contact list.<br /> *It&#8217;s only funny for 5 seconds: The application should be fast in use. Really fast. The joke&#8217;s over after having to click more than 3 buttons to suggest or read something.</p> <p>I believe that, in addition to focusing on usability, it is important in the next steps to also increase the usefulness by really innovating the recommendation process. Why? Because usability alone is not a great selling point &#8211; everyone takes it for granted something is usable. To create interest in the other chikul students Tip-it also needs some spice to distinguish it from the &#8220;mail it to a friend&#8221; button. </p> <p>Good luck <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> 	2013/03/03 01:45:18 PM

It&#8217;s like you want to users to be able to recommend anything to everyone? You might ask yourself who would want to use this? If a user is not interested in 99% of what&#8217;s being recommended by others, chances are low they&#8217;d use this application. An alternative would be to focus on a specific subject, e.g. movies. That way less people will use your application (not everyone cares about movies) but it will have an increased usefulness those users.</p> <p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use more color in your paper prototype. It&#8217;s a great way to draw focus on certain important elements. It&#8217;s also a nice way to distinguish your application from others and visually please your testers. (Note: I&#8217;m saying you have to graphically design the look &amp; feel of your app at this stage)</p> <p>Good luck!</p> 	2013/03/03 02:00:31 PM

For anyone who also took the mume12 course, the concept of a storyboard is quite different. I&#8217;m not happy with professor Duval not elaborating on this difference in storyboarding. That being said, I don&#8217;t think its wrong to draw some interface elements in the chikul-type of storyboard. I feel like It&#8217;s not a statement for how the GUI should like, it&#8217;s only a visual expression of certain features/actions that can be done.</p> 	2013/03/03 02:00:35 PM

We did not include an option to make an appointment because that would make the creation of the app more complex. A filter should be installed to see which recommendations can come with an appointment scheduling system but then we would need to make a comprehensive list of every item possible, which can be quite long <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> 	2013/03/03 03:46:45 PM

If you can come up with something special, users might be drawn to your application more that to other applications that provide the same service.</p> <p>At last, it&#8217;s nice you guys decided that the application should be used on a computer.

I think it&#8217;s not good if you only make a tool for movies. There are no people who are interested in only 1% of all categories. Users are interested in 1% of each category and in my opinion that is why you need to build a tool that can recommend everything to everyone. People can then decide who they follow or don&#8217;t follow.</p> 	2013/03/04 12:59:16 PM

There could be more detail. I don&#8217;t see a way to go back to the home screen when the user is browsing his received suggies or to cancel the creation of a new suggestion. Maybe this can be done by pressing the title, but I think users will need some time to figure that out. In my opinion, you should add a more visual indicator to go back.<br /> The tests with the users will give you the necessary feedback.</p> 	2013/03/04 03:31:04 PM

Although, while most people are right handed, there are variations in the way people use their phones. Some use their dominant hand to both hold and use the phone, others use their dominant hand to hold the phone, but the other hand for navigation. It&#8217;s possible the other way around as well. Still others could use both their hands to hold it and navigate at the same time. That being said, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s easy to proof a strong correlation between the dominant hand and the way of navigating mobile phone apps as a few other factors have to be taken into account as well, like if a hand isn&#8217;t available (already holding the TV remote for example, as our app could be used while watching a series, like shown in our storyboard), the hand used to pick up the mobile phone,&#8230;</p> <p>Unfortunaly, there aren&#8217;t many reliable studies on this specific subject (if any at all) and neither are there any clear gidelines to follow in this case, so, from my understanding, in the end it&#8217;ll come down to how much it bothers or hinders users.</p> <p>Long story short, we&#8217;ll definately take your point into consideration and, if necessary, use an alternative for the button lay-out after conducting user evaluations during the next step of the user interface design.</p> 	2013/03/04 04:16:37 PM

We think it&#8217;s important to allow users to interact with our app in a positive way only. While there&#8217;s a very slim chance this may change during the next step of our using interface design, we&#8217;d like to prevent that our app&#8217;s going to be used for hating, trolling and bashing purposes.</p> 	2013/03/04 04:16:41 PM

While I know this is just a prototype, I believe it&#8217;s quite important to take something like that into consideration early in the course of the design.</p> <p>I actually like the bold move to develop a Dutch app, as proximity is a non-neglectable reason to use your app and most people in Flanders speak Dutch. Added to that is the fact that frites are more popular in Belgium than they are in Germany or Italy, for example. However, the &#8216;Rate this&#8217; and &#8216;Rate!&#8217; buttons should be in Dutch as well.</p> <p>I think it&#8217;s also necessary to be a bit careful with the information provided by your users. People could give bad ratings on purpose or even write profanities at the comments screen for example. Are you going to take some measures to prevent or at least limit this?</p> <p>Overall, I like the simplicity of the prototype and that (except for maybe the screen at the upper right) it doesn&#8217;t look too crowded.</p> 	2013/03/04 05:17:23 PM

The idea behind this test was to find those parts that are counter intuitive or don&#8217;t work in the overall user experience of the website. If done perfectly (unlikely) all the problems that still remained on the site are found and can then be fixed. The ultimate goal is to create a program for which the user never needs to contact the support team in the first place (exept for praising them on creating the perfect program maybe). That is why I probably would not include this kind of question in the user test unless if you are working on a betha version where user responses are a major concern.</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:54 PM

I think it will be very important to make the recommendations list visually &#8216;exciting&#8217; enough (like different colours or different font sizes) to keep hold of the user&#8217;s interest.</p> <p>Also, while I know what the buttons do after reading your explanation, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s easy to understand the meaning of the &#8216;For me&#8217; and &#8216;For you&#8217; buttons in a glance. Maybe you should consider using alternative names.</p> <p>Overall, like I said, I like the interface so far and I&#8217;m looking forward to see the next step in the iteration process of your design.</p> 	2013/03/04 09:06:34 PM

Nicely written and structured!</p> <p>But I do have one remark:</p> <p>&#8220;With these observations, we can conclude that new users easily get accustomed to Pinterest[...]&#8221;</p> <p>Isn&#8217;t it true that you would come to this conclusion because the given tasks were rather simple? This is not critique on the tasks, but rather on the fact that the tests were created by new users. New users do not know (all) the features Pinterest has to offer. Because of this limitation of knowledge of the testtakers, isn&#8217;t it possible the results of the test may not be accurate?<br /> Maybe an important feature of Pinterest wasn&#8217;t discovered yet by the testtakers, and therefor wasn&#8217;t tested in form of a task. The fact that that feature wasn&#8217;t discovered could indicate that the Pinterest website isn&#8217;t that user friendly afterall, and the conclusion would be wrong..</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:55 PM

So the chance that those posts interest you is rather high.</p> <p>On the other hand, on Pinterest you can also follow people/organisations, but the first screen with pins you get to see is a general overview, not necessarily with pictures you&#8217;re interested in.<br /> If you follow some people on Pinterest and you navigate to the &#8216;following&#8217; tab, a great chance exists that those pictures interest you more than those on the main page. But it is still presented in a chaotic manner. Imho this is due to the fact that you cannot simply hide pictures/posts you&#8217;ve already watched, or you cannot select a certain way to sort the visible posts.<br /> If you compare Pinterest to Facebook: you will have noticed that Facebook has changed its layout over the years to be more usefull and orginazed. They did this for example by adding sort manners to the main page, by adding simple functionality to each post (hide post, follow post, block application..). In this way people sort and clean the shared information in a way they want to, and only the most interesting information stays visible or easy accessible.</p> <p>Maybe Pinterest is relatively young and still needs to go through these upgrades to reduce the chaos. Like we will learn (and learned a bit already) in the course of user interfaces it&#8217;s not easy to create a &#8216;good&#8217; user interface from scratch: a lot of analysis and evaluation is needed to improve faults in the user interface. In my opinion they still have a long way to go..</p> 	2013/03/01 05:49:59 PM

But it is possible in our application though to set up a one &#8211; to &#8211; many tip by filling in multiple names in the receiver field.

Further, it has to be possible to install this mobile application as a plug-in in a web browser on your mobile phone, so you can use the app in about the same way as your computer. The space on the mobile screen when you are surfing is certainly a limit that we&#8217;ll have to take into account. The remark on the URL&#8217;s is a good one. We haven&#8217;t thought about it ourselves, but this is definitely something important, because it is a lot faster when you can load mobile URL&#8217;s. This will improve certainly the usability of the application.</p> 	2013/03/05 10:30:14 AM

So even tho you are not interested in 99% of what a friend does, if he sends you that 1% that you ARE interested in, then our application works as intended. Those interesting things could still be anything, ranging from a youtube video, picture he took some days ago and wants to show you, a link to an awesome article about your favorite game etc&#8230;</p> <p>The way it happens now is you talk to them on a chat program (msn, google talk, etc ..) and send those interesting things directly. But your friend might be working on an important project at that time, and when he&#8217;s finished and wants to see those interesting things you&#8217;re no longer online. So our application wants to allow you to send those interesting things to the relevant persons and enable them to see the things at the right time. They might want to see the youtube videos and random pictures you took when they are sitting at their laptop or pc and are bored. Or see some interesting locations when they are planning what to do in the weekend etc&#8230;</p> 	2013/03/05 12:16:19 PM

I think it would be a better user experience if someone is able to give a comment why he/she liked or disliked a recommendation. Otherwise the user might have the feeling of being limited.</p> <p>Maybe you could solve the issue that comments would clutter the view, by adding a link &#8220;comment&#8221; under each recommendation. Only if you click on that link, you can view the comment(s) (or add one) of that recommendation. This way you still have a nice overview of the recommendations without comments.</p> 	2013/03/08 05:17:59 PM

Or are you actually using certain technologies of a mobile device such as a gyroscope, gps, etc? If your answer to the latter is yes then I would definitely go for a native app (web apps have a hard time accessing device specific features). Also note that if you go for a web app, your app needs to be accessed from a browser and cannot be discovered using the play-store/app-store. </p> <p>I would think on how much added value a multi-platform attempt really gives you at this time.</p> 	2013/03/11 10:19:23 AM

It is a nice extra feature, but I think you should focus on the design first. When that is good, you can always add comment features.<br /> The updates on a Facebook wall can be seen as spamming, but hey, if it makes your application famous, why not? The user can always turn of the feature. Spotify did it too and I think that was an important part in their success.</p> <p>As a user I indeed had some troubles with the advanced filters: all the sliders and the time filters weren&#8217;t very clear. I agree that a digital prototype can improve that but when I read &#8220;A second u201ctimeu201d filter was added&#8221; I think you maybe make it too complex. My advice is too just drop such extra features if it is making your design more complex. But if you manage to do it nicely then you can keep it of course.</p> 	2013/03/10 05:06:10 PM

The second iteration clearly indicates that these solutions were successful!<br /> Incorporating third-party services is critical for the success of these kind of applications nowadays (at least in my opinion). No need to reinvent the wheel <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> . It also makes sure a lot of people get to know about your application, which is always nice.<br /> Related to being a test person, i also had the feeling that some teams didn&#8217;t fully make up their mind about how certain aspects of their prototype should work. This probably is because of a lack of private (within the team) testing.<br /> To conclude, i think it&#8217;s great that your second prototype proved to be successful and i&#8217;m very interested to see how to digital prototype will turn out!</p> 	2013/03/11 12:20:37 PM

But our application is about location sharing and there can optionally be taken a picture of the environment to support the location and message that is shared.<br /> I certainly agree with how important and easy it is nowadays to incorporate third-party services instead of creating everything ourselves!</p> 	2013/03/12 02:30:34 AM

The trick is to make it so that in blends in with the rest of the interface while still doing its job. I don&#8217;t like interfaces were things &#8216;happen&#8217; just because you move over some region of the screen, but that might just be me <img src='https://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> It usually takes some time for people to get used to these features, so introducing them with a tutorial is very important.</p> 	2013/03/12 04:16:02 PM

But I donu2019t think incorrect ratings will be that big of an issue. If the +1 and -1 buttons are clearly marked and on the bottom of the screen, I think itu2019s quite clear it immediately makes the rating.</p> <p>I find it interesting you discovered the issue of the misleading visualisation of the rating. The bar indeed doesnu2019t give any idea of the amount of ratings that have been made. How did you discover this issue in user testing? And is it really an issue? Because YouTube seems to take the same approach, and you also did include the amount of ratings.</p> <p>If it is, changing the length of the bar is a possible approach to incorporate the amount of ratings in the visualisation. The problem is that rating might be less clear/visible if there are only a few votes. Have you considered other possibilities, such as a thicker bar in case of more votes? In that case you still use the complete screen width.</p> 	2013/03/17 05:49:53 PM

Might be easier to use a social-media login, where friend list already exist ?</p> <p>Secondly, you guys wanna suggest installed apps to others. To do this, you will have to access some device-specific contents, right ? So if you have to design the app for a specific platform, which platform will this be ?</p> 	2013/03/22 12:41:53 PM

I agree this can be a disadvantage if you want to go worldwide (regarding privacy and non-Twitter users)<br /> But for the scope of this project it is not a problem in our opinion. And Tiggzi makes it indeed very easy to really focus on the design and not let any back-end programming issues get in your way. So again, thanks for that tip!</p> 	2013/03/22 12:41:49 PM

When I hold my phone, my thumb, which I use to navigate through apps, is at the bottom. So it seems logical to put tabs on the bottom, because this allows people to navigate faster.</p> <p>But of course, this is just my point of view. In the next session we can evaluate this decision, by testing the usability of our application on other people.</p> 	2013/03/22 05:30:38 PM

I often find myself looking for &#8216;that really useful app i used some months ago for solving that specific problem&#8217;&#8230; and then spending half an hour just installing and uninstalling apps i thought i used (but which i didn&#8217;t use after all). So, it&#8217;s really an app i would use.<br /> One remark however: how are we supposed to pronounce &#8216;SuggY&#8217;? For English users, it might be too close to &#8216;soggy&#8217; or worse, &#8216;sucky&#8217;.

We&#8217;re planning on doing this today ourselves. Much easier to get a lot of feedback that way.</p> <p>I agree with the fact that the Explore-button is too much. Actually none of the buttons look like real buttons to me, maybe you can cut off the edges ..<br /> Also when &#8216;exploring&#8217; I need to manually delete the term &#8216;Search&#8217; from the search bar, it&#8217;s easy to fix this in Tiggzi.<br /> Third of all, I&#8217;m wondering if there isn&#8217;t a page were I can see an overview of all recommendations I already made ?</p> <p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to add it&#8217;s nice you already got some real functionality that&#8217;s working. This will give test users the feeling that they&#8217;re something real, instead of some simulation that will have some fixed effect !</p> 	2013/03/27 04:01:45 PM

If problems like this, still arise when testing your digital prototype it&#8217;s easy to change this (the color-scheme of your app can be changed in a minute). So it&#8217;s better to focus on main concerns with the paper prototype, like the location of buttons, the non-existence of buttons maybe, &#8230;</p> <p>I also agree that a change to a digital prototype can better come sooner than later, because, like I said, changes to the digital prototype are much easier to make than to the paper prototype !</p> 	2013/03/27 04:01:48 PM

It works a little slow, but you can see the different functionalities so that&#8217;s the most important thing.<br /> But I got one remark on the detail view of the recommendation &#8216;to me&#8217;, is it the intention to oblige the user always to select Like or Dislike? Because when you select one, you can&#8217;t undo that without selecting the opposite. And maybe you didn&#8217;t want to select one at all, or is that the idea?</p> 	2013/03/28 02:09:02 AM

The tab bar was very clear and I got used to the interface in a matter of seconds. I do have some small remarks. Maybe you can drop the &#8220;no image&#8221; part in the detailed result view? I also expected a check that verified whether I completed all the required fields when composing a new recommendation.

(I remember being a test-person at your first prototype app, and this now gives directly a clear overview without reading the numbers!)<br /> Maybe one remark about your new approach off the second issue. You want to automatically publish/share ratings with your friends on Facebook. I understand it would boost your app-use, but on the other hand, but I&#8217;m speaking only for myself, I don&#8217;t like this functionality on Facebook. I want to decide myself what is on my wall and what isn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s just me <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br /> Looking forward to your digital version!</p> 	2013/03/28 02:17:46 PM

You could then recommend pages very fast and that&#8217;s great. I think your approach will be the fastest of the whole group. I understand that the design is simple because it is just a first prototype but maybe you could try to use your screen real estate in a more optimal way?<br /> For example the friends page should be more like a table with rows and columns of friends instead of one friend per row.

Our goal indeed is to be fast. The idea of recommanding a site to someone is not the most original idea but is not only about the idea, it&#8217;s about how you do it.

The three mostly used browsers at the moment are Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. Our main target group to start with are people our age and by looking around a bit we noticed that the last two are more used than Internet Explorer. So we picked one to start with, but the idea is to make plugins for firefox and explorer too. My apologies towards Safari users, but a pluging for other browsers than these 3 is for a later stage.</p> 	2013/03/30 03:30:40 PM

(now the only way to identify the sender is by the profile pic i guess?)</p> <p>4) Make a recommendation<br /> - click the &#8216;recommend&#8217; button<br /> - fill in all fields<br /> - click &#8216;send&#8217;. A tweet has been posted. A remark: the number of allowed characters in the app is less than the number that is allowed by twitter (i had about 30 chars more left when posting to twitter). Why&#8217;s that? Besides that the app doesn&#8217;t take me back to the previous screen after recommending. Is that intended or is it just the preview version that has this behavior? I personally find it confusing (Has my reco been made? Did i do something wrong?) Some kind of confirmation might be helpful.</p> <p>I hope my test report gave you some useful insights!</p> 	2013/04/01 11:27:19 AM

And if you don&#8217;t want to include images, you can include a link to your previous post.</p> <p>Regarding the facebook login, although almost everybody has an account, it may be a too restrictive solution&#8230; but not sure&#8230; there other solutions also such as Twitter oauth or OpenID using google account&#8230; but this is a small detail anyway. <img src='https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> 	2013/03/21 04:58:30 PM

Because on a blog like this, it is hard to comment, this post says nothing, the previous posts only has a picture and the post before that one only lists problems without a picture of the design.. So if I want to say something useful I need to put all the different posts next to each other, I myself think that this requires too much effort.<br /> If I look at the comments that you did (not) receive I think more people are having the same problem?</p> 	2013/04/02 06:19:06 PM

Of course this can be a disadvantage if you make a super fancy paper prototype and then you realize you don&#8217;t have the skills or time to make it digital&#8230;</p> 	2013/04/02 06:19:13 PM

In the end, it&#8217;s still paper though and prone to rip with ease. Additionally, it doesn&#8217;t result in the same satisfying feeling compared to scrolling on a real smartphone. That&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s not an accurate representation of the real deal.</p> <p>While I agree not all minor issues should be ignored (as stated in our blog post), for this specific problem of clickable buttons, I think it&#8217;s faster to conduct tests with a digital prototype rather than a paper one and having to ask all test users specifically if they knew whether a certain button was clickable or not. It also helps to use verbs for buttons as they express a certain function, the user expects something to happen, so it&#8217;ll be more likely that the user knows it&#8217;s a clickable button.</p> 	2013/04/05 02:42:41 PM

I hope the whole makes a bit more sense now&#8230;</p> <p>From a UI designer&#8217;s point of view, it&#8217;s probably a misinterpretation from our side if the user didn&#8217;t get it right. We haven&#8217;t thought of all possible ways to interpret the genre selecting system, but thanks to the conducted tests, we can change it accordingly now.</p> <p>Like Benjamin also replied, it&#8217;s partly due to the prototype being a paper prototype, but like noted in a previous blog post of ours (<a href=""http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/userevaluations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hatchi13.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/userevaluations/</a>) it could also be influenced by having programmers as test users, who are more or less conditioned to thinking in computer languages and the precise functions of buttons etc.</p> "	2013/04/08 04:30:13 PM
